        "articleBody": "b'Americans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major, statewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature; in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the governor\\x19s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\\x1cGovernor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!\\x1d Trump tweeted before Election Day. \\x1cMatt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT Governor, @MattBevin!\\x1dTrump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. \\x1cVirginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today,\\x1d he said.\\x1cThe people of this country aren\\x19t buying\\x1d impeachment, Trump said at a rally in Louisiana last week. \\x1cYou see it because we\\x19re going up and they\\x19re going down.\\x1d\\x1cYou gotta give me a big win please,\\x1d he said later. \\x1cPlease.\\x1dTrump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead, they did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the first time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky Democrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state Trump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points. Democrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of victory \\x14 their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half points, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant won in a landslide.It\\x19s true that Democrats didn\\x19t run on the issue of impeachment. These races were centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and education. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where health care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear \\x14 whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act in the state \\x14 promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for work requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000 state residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well, where an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the expansion.But just because no one ran on impeachment doesn\\x19t mean it wasn\\x19t in the air. Voters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They could have elevated the president\\x19s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an unambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president\\x19s immediate political fortunes.To start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows majority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that \\x1cPresident Trump\\x19s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate.\\x1d And an overwhelming 70 percent of Americans say that the inciting offense \\x14 Trump\\x19s attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating a political rival \\x14 was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters poll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the House to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most Americans want Congress to investigate Trump if he \\x1ccommitted impeachable offenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.\\x1dWorried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these numbers and election results as vindication \\x14 proof that Democrats were right to take a narrow, focused approach to the president\\x19s wrongdoing.But it\\x19s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the table \\x14 that there\\x19s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that tackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president\\x19s phone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not just the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a classified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. These wouldn\\x19t be fishing expeditions \\x14 given the president\\x19s refusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from those of the state, there\\x19s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior across a range of areas \\x14 but they would mean a longer process. Democrats couldn\\x19t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to let it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate, remember, took more than two years to unfold.)I don\\x19t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch McConnell\\x19s hands until there\\x19s a comprehensive case against the president. Yes, there\\x19s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is any prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage over the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance, especially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would also allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to campaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a trial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full truth of what\\x19s been happening in the White House under the guise of making America great again.\\n'"

Auto Show   \\n\\n    New electric vehicles, several new small SUVs, a redesigned compact car, a plug-in version of Toyota\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top-selling vehicle and a futuristic electric station wagon concept car from Volkswagen are among the new models on display this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show.  Toyota is displaying a rechargeable hybrid version of the RAV4 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a pickup truck \\xe2\\x80\\x94 while Ford is rolling out an all-new electric SUV that carries the Mustang performance car brand name. There also is a redesigned compact Sentra from Nissan.   The show opens to the public on Friday. Here are some of the highlights:  NISSAN SENTRA  Nissan is hoping a sleek redesign of the Sentra compact sedan will pull in more buyers in a struggling segment of the U.S. market.      The 2020 Sentra, which goes on sale in late January, loses the old version\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upright econobox look. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s built on new underpinnings that lower it two inches and make it two inches wider than the outgoing model. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a coupe look that mimics the design of newer Nissan models like the Altima and Maxima. The new version gets a new 149 horsepower, 2-liter four-cylinder engine that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 20% more powerful than the current model, yet Nissan says it will offer better gas mileage. It also gets a new rear suspension and steering system to improve handling. Even though it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an entry-level car, it comes standard with six safety systems including automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. Price and gas mileage were not announced.   VOLKSWAGEN ID. SPACE VIZZION CONCEPT  Volkswagen is giving us a glimpse into the car of the future with a low-slung electric station wagon called the ID. Space Vizzion Concept.  The German automaker, which has focused on electric vehicles after its diesel emissions-cheating scandal, says the wagon will be able to go 300 miles on a single battery charge. It has a rear-mounted 275-horsepower motor, but a second motor could be installed for all-wheel-drive, giving the car 355 horsepower. The all-wheel-drive version will be able to go from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in five seconds, Volkswagen says. To limit wind drag, the car has touch surfaces on the doors in place of conventional door handles. An augmented reality 15.6-inch touch screen that appears to float in the air has all entertainment, climate control and online information. VW says the car is a preview of a production vehicle for North America and Europe, but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say when the wagon will go on sale.     FORD MUSTANG MACH E  Ford will display its first all-electric SUV, marking the start of an avalanche of battery-powered vehicles coming from mainstream and luxury automakers during the next two years that industry analysts say will boost electric vehicle sales.  Analysts expect the number of electric vehicles for sale in the U.S. to grow from 16 currently to as many as 80 by 2022. They say the increased selection and longer range of the new vehicles will make them more popular.  Ford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mustang Mach E SUV will go 230 miles to more 300 miles per charge depending on how it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equipped. It will start at $44,000, not including a $7,500 federal tax credit.  The car gets some Mustang styling cues including triple taillights, a fastback rear and a long hood. A performance GT version will be able to go from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in about 3.5 seconds.  The Mach E was unveiled Sunday night ahead of the Los Angeles show.  TOYOTA RAV4 PRIME  Toyota is rolling out a plug-in electric version of the popular RAV4 small SUV that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more efficient and faster than the current versions.  The 2021 RAV4 Prime will be able to go 39 miles (63 kilometers) on battery power alone before the gas-electric hybrid propulsion system kicks in. It will get the equivalent of 90 miles per gallon (38 kilometers per liter) of gasoline, according to Toyota. Yet the 302-horsepower system will take the car from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in 5.8 seconds \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a full two seconds faster than the current RAV4 Hybrid. The SUV, which is the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a pickup truck, has a tuned-up version of the RAV4 Hybrid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 176 hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine powering the front wheels. A separate rear-mounted electric motor powers the rear wheels when needed. Toyota says the battery is mounted under the floor, giving the SUV a lower center of gravity and improving its handling. The RAV4 Prime goes on sale in the summer. The price wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t announced.  \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b' Volkswagen\\x19s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn\\x19t expected until next year, but the automaker isn \\x18t slowing down on stacking up new potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the modular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the most striking yet.  You could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a well-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID. SPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it\\x19s weighing a potential production version for North America and Europe. \\nThe MEB\\x19s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker with the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show this week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is \\x13 at 195-inches \\x13 about as long as a VW Atlas Cross Sport SUV. However it\\x19s narrower and lower. \\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh lithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it\\x19s enough to give the ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There\\x19s electronic damping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension. \\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to the front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph could arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited 109 mph. As for range, in RWD form you\\x19re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP cycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on the EPA cycle. \\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW\\x19s engineers used some clever airflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being guided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of the car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate. \\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing wind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up; touch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical lighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined by an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime running lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.                  Turbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing them flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption. The roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear. That\\x19s also where you\\x19ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip crossing the white VW logo. All those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the ID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes headlamps that look like they\\x19re eyes opening. \\nInside, there\\x19s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench instead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there\\x19s AppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice production. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done away with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker says it\\x19ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of the material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination. \\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the driver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment, and other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can be assigned to different touch-surface controls. There\\x19s a large, fold-out center console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW\\x19s 20.7 cubic foot trunk has two electric longboards underneath.\\n                 Even the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch panels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery mode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation and other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively change to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural language voice control is supported, too. \\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a luxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes to put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market sometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the ability of that to support more niche models in a way that\\x19s still cost effective.  \\n'"

Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph\\'s helmet.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can\\'t antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. & You get what\\'s coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don\\'t blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he\\'s asking for it.

Rudolph\\'s role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett\\'s helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph\\'s supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd While Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league\\'s decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season.

Some consumers who sought help on launch day reported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others reported being abruptly logged off the service.\\x1cWe had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn\\x19t make me feel good,\\x1d Mayer, Disney\\x19s chairman of direct-to-consumer and international, said Tuesday at the Vox Media\\x19s Code Media conference in Hollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\\nDisney\\x19s tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and \\x1cpatched\\x1d the software as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout the week.

Mayer hinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\\x1cWe\\x19ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see \\x1d Mayer said.The streaming service represents a shift in Disney\\x19s business strategy and, potentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered its business. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney\\x19s flagship ESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks. \\nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services, such as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3 billion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take on Netflix at its own game. Netflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the so-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry. \\x1cWe will see the industry shake out a bit,\\x1d Mayer said. \\x1cNot everyone will succeed.\\x1d Wall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best positioned for success, and how many streaming services consumers will sign up for. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he thinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether subscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.He declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to stream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+ app. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast networks and the cable channel ESPN.Eventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its sports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that would probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\\x1cThere will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,\\x1d Mayer said. \\x1cWe want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.\\x1d Getting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer\\x19s mettle.

M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which uses a spectrograph to detect the chemical compositions of other planets\\' atmospheres by scanning the infrared light they release or absorb, the scientists only spotted water vapor in one.\"We suggest that the outgassing of water vapour on Europa occurs at lower levels than previously estimated, with only rare localized events of stronger activity,\" Paganini and his team wrote in the paper.For many years, scientists have suspected that there\\'s water on Europa\\'s surface, and several observations appear to back up that suspicion.More than two decades ago, NASA\\'s Galileo spacecraft found evidence of an electrically conductive fluid on the moon\\'s surface. Then, a 2018 analysis of the data found evidence of massive plumes of liquid. Data previously collected by NASA\\'s Hubble Space Telescope supported the existence of the plumes.\"We performed diligent safety checks to remove possible contaminants in ground-based observations,\" Goddard planetary scientist Avi Mandell said of the water vapor discovery in the statement. \"But, eventually, we\\'ll have to get closer to Europa to see what\\'s really going on.\"A mission to do just that is already lined up.NASA\\'s upcoming Europa Clipper mission will get a much closer look at the icy moon\\'s surface as soon as 2023.The spacecraft will feature a suite of cameras, spectrometers, and a radar to investigate the thickness of Europa\\'s icy shell during 45 flybys \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and perhaps yield further insights into the water vapor above the moon\\'s surface while it\\'s there.This article was originally published by Futurism.

For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported Wednesday that the air quality index reached 408, earning a rating of \\x1chazardous.\\x1d\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Air pollution in Delhi remains \\x1cunhealthy\\x1d this week. \\n      \\n      \\n        Berkeley Earth\\n      \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and it\\x19s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health Organization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the most pollution from PM2.5 \\x14 particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter that can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems \\x14 were in India. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there were 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world. India suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of these deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies of 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when pollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for years, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the country and more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is worsening for Indians. \\nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many emerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies urbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem with roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to distinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water conservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in better governance. \\nWhy Delhi\\x19s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and dilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And right now in Delhi, there\\x19s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up trapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is also landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi\\x19s more than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles run on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke motors.  Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80 percent of the region\\x19s total pollution. Dust from the city\\x19s construction boom is also a contributor to the city\\x19s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid fuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation. \\nThese sources contribute to Delhi\\x19s year-round pollution. But there are several additional factors making air quality even worse now. \\nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning fires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs. \\nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off fireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October 27 this year. \\n\\n\\nThe air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks. pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YN\\x14 Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhi\\x19s pollution right now isn\\x19t coming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of year burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and restore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these fires has wafted over the city in recent days. \\nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of residents. \\x1cIt\\x19s like you\\x19re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink that\\x19s plugged up,\\x1d Apte said. \\x1cIt overflows with spectacular consequences.\\x1d\\nDelhi\\x19s air wasn\\x19t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the rise in pollution.\\n\\x1cI\\x19m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never experienced this pollution,\\x1d said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. \\x1cThe [severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened in 2009?\\x1d\\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India\\x19s breadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this region helped deliver a food surplus to the country. \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Burning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and harming air quality. \\n      \\n      \\n        Sakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\\n      \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage as farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To combat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act. \\nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice production typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first cultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act prohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The delay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers. \\nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab\\x19s water table. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October rice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter wheat, which is typically sown mid-November. \\nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can\\x19t hire a large number of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields of the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and quickest method to prepare for the next planting \\x14 burning crop stubble. \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        This satellite image from NASA\\x19s worldview satellite shows fires detected (red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019. \\n      \\n      \\n        NASA Worldview\\n      \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\nOf course, it\\x19s not just rural pollution that\\x19s choking Delhi. The urban sources of pollution \\x14 traffic, construction, cooking fires \\x14 have also increased as the region\\x19s population has boomed by more than 7 million people in the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl. \\nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air quality in Delhi in recent years.\\nDelhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are reluctant to take aggressive action\\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting 210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops and explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival. \\nBrick kilns and factories have also been shut down this week. Delhi officials also implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution. \\nIndia\\x19s Supreme Court on Monday also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet fires have continued, showing that enforcement is a problem, and farmers are still in the early days of the crop stubble-burning season.\\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air quality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it\\x19s because of shifts in the weather \\x14 not policy. \\n\\x1cThis is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly, which allowed Delhi\\x19s air to slightly improve,\\x1d Kurinji Selvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank told CBS News.\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Officials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to schoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution. \\n      \\n      \\n        Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\\n      \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the sources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. \\x1cPart of the challenge is that there\\x19s a character of \\x18Oh no, you first,\\x19 \\x18No, you first,\\x19\\x1d Apte said. \\x1cNo one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would lead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily sharing equal portions of the blame.\\x1d\\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also a political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers, construction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have a seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid the pollution \\x14 many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious minority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old sectarian wounds. \\nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India\\x19s last election cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to stop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning, driving, fireworks, and industrial activity. \\n\\x1cPeople will be up in revolt, they\\x19ll stop trains, there will be riots, and nobody wants to get into this hassle,\\x1d Prakash said. \\x1cIt\\x19s actually a very, very noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto points.\\x1d \\nAir pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress. \\nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has been fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air quality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from dangerous smog.\\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County regularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the country as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air pollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws. \\nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many have made important progress in consistently improving air quality by enforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology. The persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of economic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries. \\nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist Simon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is impoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but beyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as pollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are implemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is getting the worst of both worlds. \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops, pollution gets worse before it gets better.\\n      \\n      \\n        Ecological Economics\\n      \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash said. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their air quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that China\\x19s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian government, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories and limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it gets done.  The government has since drastically reduced the amount of industrial and agricultural activity around the city.\\n\\x1cThe beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do it,\\x1d Prakash said. \\x1cNothing stands between the decision and the implementation.\\x1d\\nThat\\x19s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To clear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies and incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics, helping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their harvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble. \\nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward charity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers and reduce pollution. \\nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner energy. \\x1cIf one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to pollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,\\x1d Prakash said. It\\x19s not just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and trucks. \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Heavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in Delhi.\\n      \\n      \\n        Biplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\\n      \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable energy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would more than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to 450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions. \\nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for economic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to accept the tradeoffs. \\nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used, a region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make a difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money, and foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing metropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos, Nigeria. \\x1cThe problem can be solved,\\x1d Prakash said. \\x1cBut what you need is political will and a bit of imagination.\\x1d\\n\\n\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'Columnists21:17 18.11.2019Get short URLWhat was this British royal and his PR aides thinking of when he granted a high-profile interview to the BBC, supposedly to clear his name from association with sex-trafficker billionaire Jeffrey Epstein?Prince Andrew, the nearly 60-year-old younger brother of heir to the British throne, Charles, has reportedly told friends and family that the interview aired at the weekend was a \\x1cgreat success\\x1d.\\nIn it, the British royal blankly denied having sex with underage girls supplied to him by the convicted pedophile Epstein who reportedly committed suicide in August while in custody in a US prison. The denials were in spite of the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City mansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for sex parties.\\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is, the general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and disgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but \\x1can articulated lorry crash\\x1d performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent media suspicions of culpability in Epstein\\x19s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has left himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and evasions.\\n\\x1cPrince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the royal family,\\x1d said one legal expert, as reported by the Independent newspaper.\\n\\x1cHis friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,\\x1d the expert warned.\\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and contradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of alleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein\\x19s \\x1cunbecoming\\x1d behavior (classic aloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an alibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18 years ago \\x13 on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a house in London belonging to Epstein\\x19s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A photo of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited Epstein in New York in 2010 \\x13 after Epstein was released from prison for trafficking a minor for prostitution \\x13 in order to terminate his friendship.\\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in person that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of friendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein\\x19s orgy mansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with Epstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how vulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\\nHe instead told the BBC interviewer: \\x1cI took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over the telephone was the chicken\\x19s way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him.\\x1d\\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The rectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all this purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein contradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were \\x1cnot close\\x1d.\\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations punctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew\\x19s otherwise \\x1clack of remorse\\x1d or \\x1csympathy\\x1d with the victims of Epstein\\x19s sex abuse empire, as expressed in the BBC interview.\\nLawyers for Epstein\\x19s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview given by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by prosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-indictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for questioning.\\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice from several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated media fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen Elizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work, publicly-funded royals are.\\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands War (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience allegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body sweating.\\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak. Let\\x19s see if he can keep his royal pants dry this time. The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik. \\n'"

But Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just three four times in his first 18 games. \\n\\x1cYou can go either way,\\x1d Parise said. \\x1cI was going the other way for a little while. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.\\x1d Parise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the neutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek\\x19s feed on a two-on-one. He tipped Suter\\x19s shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres. \\x1cHe\\x19s starting to feel it a little bit again,\\x1d Boudreau said. \\x1cAnd we need those goals.\\x1d The Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been on his players to avoid looking at the standings. \\x1cIt\\x19s hard not to, though,\\x1d Suter acknowledged. \\x1cWe know where we are, we know what we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step forward.\\x1d Boudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to \\x1cbelieve in yourselves\\x1d and that the Wild are a \\x1cgood team.\\x1d \\x1cYou\\x19ve beaten some really good teams this year,\\x1d he said he said he told them. \\x1cYou\\x19ve been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start believing in yourself, then good things are going to happen. \\x1cI said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because I knew they were a good team but they just weren\\x19t playing good.\\x1d The Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching start, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In the second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw punches, although neither player received a fighting major. \\x1cI didn\\x19t really see him coming,\\x1d Eriksson Ek said. \\x1cHe came off my back and, like, I just wasn\\x19t ready for it.\\x1d Parise said: \\x1cWe\\x19ve been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under their skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.\\x1d Eichel said he was \\x1cjust trying to spark some energy.\\x1d Meanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan Dubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots. Sabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third period. Defenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason Zucker\\x19s empty-net goal sealed it. The Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an undisclosed injury. \\x1cI haven\\x19t talked to the trainers at all,\\x1d Boudreau said. \\n'"

Walmart\\'s Black Friday adscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\\nPS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\\nThe price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to Black Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the DualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its color and matte texture, it\\'s also the least likely of your controllers to look grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.\\n\\tGet it on Amazon for 39.99\\n\\nNintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\\nSave $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword or Shield and a case.

You\\'ll save $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let\\'s face it, most people probably won\\'t fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates compared to the Series 3. What everyone will appreciate, though, is the extra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that\\'s waterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small, sleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.\\n\\tGet it on Amazon for $169.99\\tAlso at Walmart\\n\\nNew Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139 (Originally $159)\\nIt\\'s a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very popular Apple Airpods.

The GTX 1660 Ti is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw performance. It\\'s paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.\\n\\tUse code \"50OFF699\" to get it at Dell for $799.99\\n Clip the $10 off coupon on the product pageThe Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and non-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive score and I\\'m not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk X4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters can\\'t go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can\\'t go over AC1200 speeds), anything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if you run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn\\'t use that over WiFi anyways.\\tGet it on Amazon for $67.77\\n This sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane.\\nIf you\\'re still using the same password (or a variant of the same password) for every site you visit, you\\'re putting yourself at risk. With so many sites experiencing data breaches, it\\'s all but guaranteed that someone\\'s going to uncover your login info one day\\x14and if you use the same credentials across multiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your sensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by randomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and automatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of the best password managers of 2019. Dashlane offers a free version of its software that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill functionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is available) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web Monitoring, and secure VPN.\\n\\tDownload Dashlane Password Manager for Free\\n This deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but you don\\'t have to be a Prime member. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for just $1. Normally you\\'d be paying $9.99/month for this service (or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed, but it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make sure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free versions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists that you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.\\n\\tGet 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\\n Save a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or Gray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven\\'t seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.\\n\\tGet it at Walmart for $249.95\\n After a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian and Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the same titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It\\'s lighter and the controls are non-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch Pro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can\\'t play in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to play the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay. \"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\" Read our Pokemon Sword and Shield review.If you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has the best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if you get either version. Normally this deal ends when the game is released, but we confirmed that you do still actually receive the credit. Undoubtedly it will end very, very soon so hurry!\\tGet Pokemon Sword on Amazon for $58.99\\tGet Pokemon Shield for $58.56\\n I think this will be the least expensive 70\"+ TV during the Black Friday season. This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated Smart TV interface available. There\\'s even free shipping and it\\'s eligible for extended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart by January for whatever reason).\\n\\tGet it at Walmart for $499.99\\n The new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and the upgrades are worth getting merry over. These are the first AirPods with active noise cancellation, and despite the technology they still feature up to 5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include three sets of silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell, and a wireless charger case that can provide up to 24 hours of battery life. If you\\'re hoping the price will drop on Black Friday... you\\'re fooling yourself. Even now, the shipping has been delayed which means these will go out of stock very soon.\\n\\tGet it on Amazon for $234.98\\n The 2,812 piece Betrayal at Cloud City reenactment measures 22\" long and 22\" wide and is the first in an Expert class of LEGO Star Wars sets called the \"Master Builder Series\". The Master Builder Series is similar to the Ultimate Collector Series in complexity, scale, and probably resale value. The primary difference is that the Master Builder Series sets emphasizes playability whereas the UCS sets focus on authenticity. This is the biggest discount ever for the Cloud City set, and probably won\\'t last.\\n\\tGet it on Amazon for $243.97\\n Disney+ is now live and you can watch a dazzling number of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars movies and shows all from a single subscription. This is also currently the only way to watch the new big Star Wars TV series, The Mandalorian, which airs starting today.If you just want Disney+, you can sign up for a free 7-day trial. Afterwards you\\'ll pay $6.99 per month. If you know you\\'re in it for the long haul, then you can pay a $69.99 annual subscription fee, which saves you $14.An even better deal is if you sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle. In that case you pay only $12.99. If you were to subscribe to all thee services separately, you\\'d be paying around $17.99 per month, so you\\'d be saving $60 every year.\\nNote: The bundle includes Hulu with limited commercials. If you want ad-free Hulu, you will have to upgrade to it BEFORE signing up for the bundle plan. Here\\'s the TL;DR version of signing up for ad-free Hulu as part of the Disney+ bundled package: Eric Song is IGN\\'s deal curator and spends 25% of his pay on stuff he posts.\\n'"

While some people carry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their personal and professional tasks on the same device. \\nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are writing custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff. \\nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he\\'s extremely proud of his company\\'s trajectory on that front. \\nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has redefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"\\x14and someone he\\'s learned a lot from. \\nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said. \\nTo that, Cook joked that he\\'s not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the Dreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff\\'s keynote with a couple songs. \\nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he did an internship at the company. \\nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base as the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on mobile devices. \\nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration. \\n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don\\x19t even own a computer anymore and I don\\x19t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good job.\" \\nSalesforce\\'s CEO marveled at Apple\\'s ability to innovate for so many decades. \\nCook said the admiration is mutual. \\n\"I love the way you\\'re constantly taking all the new things and quickly incorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told Benioff. \\nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba Buena theater on the grounds of San Francisco\\'s Moscone Center, where on the same stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products. \\nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script in a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\" \\n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said. \\nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to exchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such a great leader. \\n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he passed, you\\'ve been so true to him and his values.\" \\nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human right\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook said. \\nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it\\'s legally required to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while encouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well. \\nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to receive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they grew up after entering undocumented. \\nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love of their country and commitment to it.\" \\nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook said, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\" \\n'"

CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsentenced to life in federal prison.\\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child\\'s mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill\\'s WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.It was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb\\'s room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb\\'s Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.The video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He\\'s in custody; we have her.\"Following a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.According to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth\\'s 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim\\'s mother knocked to the ground as Webb\\'s car drives away.The victim\\'s mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter\\'s life.\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge\\'s decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.

        "articleBody": "b'The latest wave of tech-based financial startups have a new angle on the banking sector: They\\x19ll assume that everyone is out of money, then try to monetize their brokeness.So-called neo-banks, or challenger banks, have been all the rage in Europe and Australia for the past few years. Now they\\x19re starting to get attention here in the US, with names like Chime, Varo, SoFi, Current, GoBank, and even\\x14heaven help us\\x14booyah!. Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Like Yahoo!. Cutting edge, I know.These neo-banks have been trying to make money in the usual ways: By taking a cut of credit or debit card transactions, collecting interest on consumer deposits, and making loans. The usual banking stuff.Their come-on is that they\\x19re super-convenient, all-digital, mobile alternatives to the big banks. Better yet, they\\x19re focused on their customers\\x19 \\x1cfinancial health,\\x1d as one neo-bank CEO told me, and easing the \\x1cpain\\x1d that people feel around their money.What makes that pain go away? At Chime and Varo, you can get what sounds a little like a neo\\x13payday loan\\x14your paycheck cashed, up to two days before your actual payday. Checking accounts at these startups are often free, and the companies will let you go $50 or $100 into the red before they start charging any overdraft fees. Some have automated savings accounts that invisibly funnel a few dollars from your paycheck into savings.These neo-banks aren\\x19t necessarily even banks at all; some are apps that facilitate transactions, which are then carried out by partners that are banks. Others have applied for bank charters while touting their homegrown technology stacks and hyperpersonalized product offerings (based, of course, on your personal data). But all of them say, explicitly or by intimation, that they\\x19re mission-driven. Their mission is the hot mess that is your finances.The hot mess is very real. Seventy-eight percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Student loan obligations in this country total $1.5 trillion, and researchers believe they\\x19re cutting into millennials\\x19 ability to buy homes, have kids, and save for retirement. More than 40 percent of households have some credit card debt: The average liability is more than $5,000, and the poorer you are, the more you\\x19re likely to have.So what better fix than to slap a slick veneer of tech over basic banking services, push the ouroboros paycheck cycle up by a couple of days, offer some basic budgeting tools, and call it a revolution in consumer banking?Better banking isn\\x19t a bad idea, nor is it a tough sell. There\\x19s definitely an ambient frustration with the megabanks that have destroyed the global economy, bilked consumers with fake accounts and hidden terms, propped themselves up on the comfortable elbow of your overdraft fees, routinely discriminated against people of color, and on and on and on. I mean, there really should be a mission to take customers away from these companies. At minimum, it\\x19s smart to capitalize on all of this well-earned consumer rage.Still, it\\x19s deeply depressing to attend a large gathering of executives, founders, and industry veterans, as I did at October\\x19s Money 20/20 conference, and hear the same, somber message repeated over and over again: The future of money will be predicated on the fact that the personal finances of the next generation are as fragile as a Faberg\\xef\\xbf\\xbd egg. This, according to attendees and speakers, is both a problem and an opportunity. No one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation\\x19s finances isn\\x19t technology\\x19s problem to solve.\\n'"

For this years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 edition of Amsterdam Light Festival artists, designers and architects from sixteen different countries share their interpretation of the central theme \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Medium is the Message\\xe2\\x80\\x99. All participating artworks will be lit simultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the historical center of Amsterdam \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which can be experienced in different ways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time, visitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be presented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the festival. Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019.\\nCover image: artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impression of the lighting installation by\\xc2\\xa0Peter Koros Design at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival A selection of the participating artists and artworks:\\nIvana Jeli\\xc4\\x87 and Pavle Petrovi\\xc4\\x87 (Serbia) found inspiration for their work Starry Night in Van Gogh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous painting of the same name. Since the beginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution, starry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation Starry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night back, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\\nGroupe LAPS (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and often integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the festival, the French artist collective designed Spider on the Bridge: eighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on the bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion that the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors are warned!\\nAmigo & amigo (Australia) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone Chua \\xe2\\x80\\x93 explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their technically complex artworks. Parabolic Lightcloud is a cloud of light made with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this installation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors to think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts. Moreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope made out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\\nOGE Group (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and Gaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work is characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with Light a Wish as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\\nBalmond Studio (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The studio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With Optilli,\\xc2\\xa0Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the subjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon as the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The question is: is the displayed image correct? Light as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam\\nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty artworks. This years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exhibition revolves around the theme \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Medium is the Message\\xe2\\x80\\x98, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and philosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the way we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The participating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play as a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise have remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories is also a central part of this edition.\\nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of remarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be released as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn identifies the connection between the city and the central theme.

        "articleBody": "b'\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday unveiled the first global geological map of Saturn\\'s moon Titan including vast plains and dunes of frozen organic material and lakes of liquid methane, illuminating an exotic world considered a strong candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.\\nThe map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA\\'s Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017. Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the Solar System\\'s second-biggest moon behind Jupiter\\'s Ganymede. It is larger than the planet Mercury.Organic materials - carbon-based compounds critical for fostering living organisms - play a leading role on Titan.\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many of us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan\\'s icy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and this can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added Lopes, who led the research published in the journal Nature Astronomy.The first global geologic map of Titan. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU)On Earth, water rains down from clouds and fills rivers, lakes and oceans. On Titan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on Earth - in liquid form due to the moon\\'s frigid climate.Rainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than the poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency research fellow.Plains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of the surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate Titan\\'s mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.Titan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids on the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at its polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed portions of Titan\\'s crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more complex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep subsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.Noting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a hydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something like it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a little warmer?\"The map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch its Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan\\'s chemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying around on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Tom Brown)\\xc2\\xa9 Reuters \\n'"

The deal sets up for a reduction to a prior commitment of 777x jets from the U.S. plane-maker, down by 30 to 126, which Emirates is opting for by employing its substitution rights. The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.The mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing\\'s Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.It comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan\\'s Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.Emirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline \\x14 the largest international carrier in the world \\x14 will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.As of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.Emirates is the number one buyer of Airbus\\' iconic A380, the world\\'s largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry\\'s symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\\n'"

Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances.

        "articleBody": "b' The formation of galaxies is a complex dance between matter and energy, occurring on a stage of cosmic proportions and spanning billions of years. How the diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from the fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved puzzles of cosmology.In search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most detailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call TNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains tens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen only in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gases, stars and supermassive black holes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key insights into our own universe\\'s past, revealing how various oddly shaped galaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black holes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two articles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdRelated: From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through TimeTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project, which aims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of individual galaxies.\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting and understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said Paul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and co-author of the study. \"What\\'s fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you\\'re getting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies that give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems looks like as they form and evolve.\"The model\\'s attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required 16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany, running continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a single processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most computationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers believe their investment has paid off.\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.\"The violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures (in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel cosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG Collaboration)That emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe appears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed researchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent clouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered that the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally emerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including spiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black holes. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life observations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively consistent with reality.Related: The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our UniverseAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks, another phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive black holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas. These outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years above a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back unto the galaxy\\'s disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a feedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients for forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy\\'s structure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into thin rotating disks.Despite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their model. They also plan to release all of the simulation\\'s data publicly for astronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\"There\\'s a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations completed,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better understand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent trends show up in that data.\"Originally published on Live Science.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdNeed more space?

        "articleBody": "b' Audi has revealed the second production model in its e-tron all-electric range, with the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback making its debut at the LA Auto Show. Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.  It\\x19s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile. \\nAt the front, there\\x19s Audi\\x19s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It\\x19s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road \\x13 such as markings \\x13 with extra-precision. \\nFor the rear, there\\x19s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap. \\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It\\x19ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper. Europe will get the option of Audi\\x19s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations. Power and Performance\\nIn Europe, there\\x19ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They\\x19ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power. \\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph. It\\x19ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to \\x1cS\\x1d and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It\\x19s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds. \\nQuattro is standard, and there\\x19s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select \\x13 with seven different drive modes \\x13 will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches. Range and Charging\\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It\\x19s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors. \\nStill, there\\x19ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging. For Level 2 stations, there\\x19ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge \\x13 which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in \\x13 will also be enabled in 2020. \\nInterior and Technology\\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or \\x1cfrunk,\\x1d you\\x19re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\\n\\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker\\x19s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There\\x19ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package. A Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi\\x19s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional. \\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there\\x19ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it\\x19ll also be used to control a new \\x1cfunctions on demand\\x1d system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis. Audi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems. \\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback \\x1cedition one\\x1d: it\\x19ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020. US pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.  \\n'"

In fact, Nissan still believes in sedans for their practicality, space, as well as looks.\\nAfter debuting the all-new Juke two months ago, Nissan has taken the covers off the eighth-generation Sentra. Featuring a new head-turning design that is paired to a more luxurious-looking cabin, the compact four-door has been redesigned from the ground-up and is more vibrant than ever.\\n\\n\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the U.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the all-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality, technology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic design cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,\\x1d said David Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at Nissan North America Inc.\\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front grill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also has a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra\\'s sportier design. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated finish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke alloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\\n\\nInside, the Sentra\\'s interior has been refined and is covered in high quality materials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are all wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up the overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and front passenger, it has Nissan\\'s NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come with a heated function.\\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It also doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows for safer parking / maneuvering.\\n\\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the previous 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of torque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared to the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new 2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra. These include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision warning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\\n\\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January. As to when will this arrive in the Philippines, we\\'re not entirely sure yet but it could make its ASEAN debut at the 2020 Bangkok International Motor Show. But will we still call it the Sylphy once it arrives here?

        "articleBody": "b' \\nThe bizarre odyssey of how Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen came to co-write the euphoric power-ballad that Jessie Buckley performs at the end of \\x1cWild Rose\\x1d \\x14 easily the year\\x19s best original movie song \\x14 began 10 years ago, when the \\x1cMelvin and Howard\\x1d star woke up after a minor arm surgery feeling like her mind was on fire.\\n\\x1cI felt strange as soon as the anesthesia started to wear off,\\x1d Steenburgen said. \\x1cThe best way I can describe it is that it just felt like my brain was only music, and that everything anybody said to me became musical. All of my thoughts became musical. Every street sign became musical. I couldn\\x19t get my mind into any other mode.\\x1d\\nFun as that might sound in an Oliver Sacks kind of way \\x14 the late neurologist wrote about similar, potentially stroke-inspired symptoms in his book \\x1cMusicophilia\\x1d \\x14 \\xef\\xbf\\xbdSteenburgen wasn\\x19t thrilled about the sudden mental shift. The next two months were tough. \\x1cI couldn\\x19t focus, I couldn\\x19t have acted,\\x1d she said. \\x1cI couldn\\x19t have learned any lines. My husband [actor Ted Danson] and I were kind of frightened about it.\\x1d Steenburgen\\x19s son, filmmaker Charlie McDowell (\\x1cThe Discovery,\\x1d \\x1cThe One I Love\\x1d), also remembers it as a trying time. \\x1cIf your mom comes to you after surgery and says that her head is now full of music, I think it\\x19s totally fair to think that she\\x19s gone crazy and has major psychological problems,\\x1d he said. \\x1cAll of a sudden she was referencing these obscure indie bands and picking up random instruments \\x14 I\\x19m not gonna lie, the accordion playing drives me nuts,\\x1d\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMcDowell laughed. \\x1cWhen I say all this out loud it sounds insane. It was definitely a change.\\x1d\\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasn\\x19t exactly itching to do something else. \\x1cI had been somebody who really liked music,\\x1d she said, \\x1cbut I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with acting, and that felt like a big enough subject for me.\\x1d\\nWhen the music didn\\x19t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do something with it \\x14 if only for her sanity \\x14 even though she didn\\x19t know how to play an instrument. \\x1cI called a very talented friend of mine on Martha\\x19s Vineyard and I said: \\x18Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in my head, could you help me make them into songs?\\x19\\x1d she said. She wrote hundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer under her mother\\x19s name. \\x1cHe wanted to work with \\x18Nellie Wall,\\x19 but then I showed up instead,\\x1d she said.\\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a songwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a strange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckley\\x19s doorstep almost a decade later. \\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper \\x14 a young British filmmaker hot off directing a lush BBC adaptation of \\x1cWar & Peace\\x1d \\x14 had just found his next project. He\\x19d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called \\x1cWild Rose,\\x1d a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian country singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline ballads at Nashville\\x19s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley \\x14 who landed a key role in \\x1cWar & Peace\\x1d after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition \\x1cI\\x19d Do Anything\\x1d \\x14 had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones that she was perfect for the part.\\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie together didn\\x19t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that Rose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after she\\x19s learned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both feel a little more special, but no details.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPhoning in from London,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHarper remembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece: \\x1cThe script just said something along the lines of, \\x18Rose-Lynn sings an incredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom and kids and everyone\\x19s uplifted. The end,\\x19\\x1d Harper said. \\x1cI had faith that we could figure it out, but it was really worrying.\\x1d Universal\\x19s music division provided some demos, but none of them clicked.\\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called \\x1cGlasgow (\\x1cNo Place Like Home\\x1d). \\x1cIt grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,\\x1d he said. \\x1cIt just connected.\\x1d Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of \\x1cFargo,\\x1d had a similar experience: \\x1cIt was just that immediate feeling of \\x18this is the song.\\x19\\x1d\\nThat\\x19s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found themselves blindsided by \\x1cthe Mary Steenburgen of it all.\\x1d\\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">&#65279;</span>\\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her own dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her fame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than Rose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. \\x1cIt was terrifying,\\x1d she said. \\x1cThe first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my hotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought \\x18Why would anyone be so stupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?\\x19\\x1d\\nBut she also felt like she didn\\x19t have much of a choice. \\x1cI was back at it by the next morning,\\x1d she said. \\x1cI just told myself: \\x18I\\x19m going to go right up and sing the bleeping song if it kills me!\\x19\\x1d Not long after that, Steenburgen bought a house in Nashville.\\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to scat in the backseat of his car. \\x1cIt could have been really easy for Mary Steenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the usual steps in some new creative thing, but she didn\\x19t do that,\\x1d she said. \\x1cShe put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to admit, she\\x19s gotten really good at the accordion.\\x1d Steenburgen\\x19s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the competition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for \\x1cWild Rose\\x1d were content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there, Steenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her to play. \\x1cI fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was looking at such a small part of the story without it,\\x1d she said. \\x1cWhere does Rose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of imagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the cinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people you haven\\x19t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the whole thing, I understood what we were writing.\\x1d\\nThat process led to a realization: \\x1cIt was a really love song from Rose-Lynn to her mother &It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the concept of home and the fact that home doesn\\x19t have to be second best for her or something that she settles for.\\x1d\\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">&#65279;</span>\\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the television show \\x1cNashville,\\x1d Steenburgen\\x19s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate York came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of writing character-driven chords. \\x1cIt\\x19s a totally different muscle,\\x1d York said. \\x1cYou have to take yourself out of it a little bit \\x14 it\\x19s kind of like acting, I guess.\\x1d Smith agreed: \\x1cIt\\x19s a different job altogether. If you\\x19re just writing a song for someone else, it\\x19s wide open and sometimes hard to figure out. And if you\\x19re writing for yourself, you\\x19re really digging into your own heart.\\x1d This particular task was a little bit of both. \\x1cI feel like we could get into the guts of this song because we\\x19ve all lived a similar crazy dream story,\\x1d Smith said.\\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so the three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA (not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-you\\x19ll-miss-it cameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on something with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the songwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynn\\x19s life, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\\n\\x1cAnything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,\\x1d Steenburgen said. \\x1cSo I called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny and ended up like a sister,\\x1d a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot of the film. \\x1cSo I called her up and said \\x18Talk to me in your accent \\x14 talk to me about you.\\x19 And through that we wound up with images like the opening line: \\x18I\\x19ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.\\x19\\x1d The entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours \\x14 which, when you listen to \\x1cGlasgow,\\x1d seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen to co-write it. \\x1cIt may sound shallow or like it\\x19s a factory when I talk about how fast we write these things,\\x1d Steenburgen said, \\x1cbut I always think of it like this: \\x18I can\\x19t take days to do a scene.\\x19 I can\\x19t say \\x18I don\\x19t know what the emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?\\x19 I\\x19m always having to tell stories on a time limit.\\x1d Steenburgen has only found one drawback to collaborating with Smith and York: \\x1cThey\\x19re such good singers that people are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, \\x18Well I can\\x19t sing like that, so I\\x19m not doing that song.\\x19\\x1d\\n\\x1cWild Rose\\x1d1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\\nBuckley, who hadn\\x19t sung in a long time before the production, worried about doing justice to a song like \\x1cGlasgow,\\x1d especially given that she had no background in country music. \\x1cBut the story of it really moved me,\\x1d she said, \\x1cso I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just tried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.\\x1d\\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-surprised: \\x1cIt made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex understanding of character \\x14 someone who was able to kind of go right to the root of what this woman\\x19s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that exposed the cracks under the surface,\\x1d she said.\\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew a distinction with her character. \\x1cI told her my secrets and she told me hers and we built a different person together,\\x1d she said. \\x1c\\x18Glasgow\\x19 is a song of belonging. It\\x19s about stretching yourself to places that you don\\x19t know are within yourself.\\x1d For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to sing about. \\x1cThis song was such a gift to me,\\x1d she said. In turn, it also became her gift to the women who wrote it.\\nSteenburgen called Buckley\\x19s performance \\x1cstunning,\\x1d but seemed changed by the experience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved. \\x1cMusic is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was somehow granted access to it,\\x1d she said. \\x1cIt was so overwhelming for me in the beginning because I didn\\x19t grow up with having that voice in my head, like Kate and Caitlyn did.\\x1d\\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">&#65279;</span>\\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the film\\x19s last scene conveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It begins with Buckley\\x19s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn summons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She apologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to escape: \\x1cI pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.\\x1d A faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the first ray of sunshine after a squall: It\\x19s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynn\\x19s way towards a place she never could have imagined before. \\x1cHad to find my own way, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,\\x1d she sings. \\x1cAin\\x19t no yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one that\\x19s stronger than stone.\\x1d\\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone who\\x19s tunneled their way to freedom, as Buckley\\x19s voice swells from low to high and back again. She sings on behalf of anyone who\\x19s ever had to learn about themselves the hard way: \\x1cAin\\x19t no place like home,\\x1d she and Rose-Lynn sing together, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along with all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the 12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. It\\x19s staggering.\\nIt\\x19s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet, happiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When Steenburgen\\x19s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird quirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream she\\x19d had since she was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new reality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her now, it sounds like she\\x19s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\\n\\x1cI didn\\x19t fall out of love with acting when this happened,\\x1d Steenburgen said, \\x1cand I still haven\\x19t. But there\\x19s so much more capability in our brains than we probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a choice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you don\\x19t really have to do that.\\x1d\\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">&#65279;</span>\\n\\x1cWild Rose\\x1d is now available on DVD and VOD.

        "articleBody": "b'Remember New Jersey\\x19s epic quest to find a state slogan?(We never did settle on one, unlike our 565 municipalities, which are packed with them.)Enter South Dakota to throw down the gauntlet. The state\\x19s new slogan for an anti-drug campaign drew a South Dakota-sized share of attention on social media Monday.Just what is this priceless slogan?\\x1cMeth. We\\x19re on it.\\x1dYes, that\\x19s it. No joke. The governor of South Dakota would like us to know that her state is on meth. You know, like solving the problem. On it!Of course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that Florida Man will have to up the ante next time.And if you haven\\x19t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on Twitter pointed it out.So many people were talking about South Dakota\\x19s odd new slogan that the state and \\x1cWe\\x19re On It\" became top Twitter trends.According to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem launched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state\\x19s meth crisis.\\x1cMeth. We\\x19re on it\\x1d is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which people say, \\x1cI\\x19m on meth.\\x1dThe report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the campaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year.Noem saw the Twitter reaction and ... doubled down on the slogan.\\x1cHey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness,\\x1d Noem tweeted. \\x1cSo I think that\\x19s working.\\x1dShe proceeded to share the hashtag #MethWeAreOnIt and onmeth.com, the website for the initiative, which contains the following statement:\\x1cSouth Dakota has a problem. There isn\\x19t a single solution because meth is widespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn\\x19t take over counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let\\x19s work together. Meth. We\\x19re on it.\\x1dStill, this isn\\x19t the first time a slogan has gone awry in South Dakota.Consider this 2014 entry \\x14 \\x1cDon\\x19t jerk and drive,\" meant to discourage drivers from jerking the wheels of their cars while traveling on icy roads.The road safety slogan was an intentional play for a double entendre, but drew enough criticism to get the ax from the state Department of Public Safety.Have a tip?

        "articleBody": "b\"Washington, DC, United States: Getting to the Moon, while not easy, has been done. Staying on the Moon and reaching Mars, however, haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Why? Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\\nIt is for that reason that the United States's space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upstarts - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xc2\\xa0Blue Origin and Elon Musk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SpaceX among them - to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\\nMore: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is based on our objectives, the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed  to that timeline. \\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctechnical challenges, cost increases and   schedule delays\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The report and Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\\nIn May, NASA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expanded to Jupiter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moon Europa, as NASA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s icy crust.\\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water - are on Europa.\\nCloser to home, NASA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been on last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original list.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very exciting times. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using our Blue Moon lander, which is [a] big one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value  of $2.6bn over the next decade. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpace exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Michael Sims, CEO and Founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\""

        "articleBody": "b'   Experience is thrilled to have Junior Gaspard, long time ExpApper, as our new President and CEO.\\nWe\\x19ve asked him to share some insights into the business of Experience and what\\x19s next on the horizon for the company.\\nAlso, we hope you have as much fun as we did getting to know him better! Here\\x19s what he had to say&\\nQ: Junior \\x13 We are so excited to have you as our new President and CEO. When you woke up that first morning and you were officially in charge, what are two words to describe how it felt?\\nA: Inspired and humbled! To be in this role, for this awesome company, at this particular time, is tremendous. Words cannot describe how much I love Experience and am honored to be here serving as President and CEO. There has been a lot of change in the live entertainment and ticketing industry over the past six years since I joined the company. Being able to play a role in that change has been a lot of fun. I wake up every day looking forward to coming to work as Experience is impacting the next wave of innovation in the industry. Also, our products, people and partners are top notch and inspire me each and every day!\\nQ: What\\x19s the one thing you\\x19ve learned in your past roles that is the most helpful as CEO?\\nA: I think the importance of empathetic listening to truly understand where a person is coming from is the biggest lesson I\\x19ve learned. I would also add being comfortable making decisions with imperfect information is critical. You must be data driven when evaluating where to go and what to do, but in a rapidly evolving market, you\\x19re never going to always have 100 percent complete information. When that happens, you have to be comfortable with that reality and be prepared to make decisions regardless.\\nQ: How do you prioritize your day?\\nA: I have been well served in my career by using Steven Covey\\x19s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a guide. One of the habits \\x13 \\x1cPut first things first\\x1d, ensures I keep the things that are most important and urgent at the top of the list. I also use Wunderlist as a tool for knocking out smaller items on the to-do list. I block time for meetings and separate time for emails so I\\x19m not back and forth all day and can stay focused on the task at hand.    The best thing about Experience are the people who work here and our outstanding 350 partners - you couldn\\x19t ask for better of either. Our employees are smart, dedicated, and enthusiastic, I\\x19m honored to serve them every day as we continue on this journey to change the ticketing industry. Our partners are innovative, collaborative and willing to try new things with us, which is priceless.         A: We are moving subscription access to the next level with our direct to consumer offering called INWEGO which offers unlimited access to tickets for a flat fee each month. Also, we are working directly with partners to create a dedicated area of their venue for subscription access. This idea of a section just for subscription is a new take and one that we think will change the industry and ticketing forever. Our product will also be using data in a new way to be more prescriptive and predictive. Our partners will be able to target fans with more relevant offers and experiences and we\\x19ll be much more intelligent about fan preferences and profiles. No one else can combine the technology, a proven track record and relationships like Experience \\x13 we can\\x19t wait to roll this out, so stay tuned!\\nQ: So far in your journey, tell me one thing that has surprised you the most?\\nA: Being President and CEO requires that you look at all facets of the business each and every day. The thing that has been most surprising is the number of constituents you have and the need to invest in those relationships regularly. This is something I knew intellectually coming into the role, but the need to balance the internal and external relationships with employees, clients, strategic partners, media, etc.. requires a clear plan and direct approach.\\nQ: In reading the SportsBusiness Journal, it was noted that you\\x19ve been named a 40 Under 40 Award recipient. Congratulations!!! What\\x19s it like to be named a 40 Under 40?\\nA: I am very honored to be on the SBJ 40 Under 40 list. It\\x19s a very prestigious group of folks this year \\x13 and in years past \\x13 and I am so appreciative of the recognition. I thank my family and the wonderful people I work with for their encouragement and support. It really means a lot and I share this recognition with the entire Experience team.\\nOk, now for a little fun.\\nQ: Where did you grow up?\\nA: St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands \\x13 the most beautiful 87 square miles in the world (I am biased) and home of five time NBA champion Tim Duncan.\\nQ: Favorite childhood memory?\\nA: Trip to Disney World\\nQ: Favorite apps?\\nA: Bleacher Report, Uber Eats, and ParkMobile        A: Bob Marley, Bruno Mars, Drake, The Eagles, Jay Z, Frank Sinatra\\nQ: Favorite books?\\nA: A Fistful of Rice and The Hard Thing About Hard Things\\nQ: Favorite live event you\\x19ve ever attended?\\nA: Broncos vs. Raiders at Mile High Stadium in the Peyton Manning record breaking season. He threw five touchdowns and the crowd was absolutely rocking!\\nQ: Favorite athlete?\\nA: Lebron James\\nQ: Favorite places you have visited?\\nA: Tie between Istanbul, Turkey and Cape Town, South Africa\\nQ: Most memorable live event experience?\\nA: Watching from courtside as Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant scored 50 plus points a piece in a triple overtime game in their last season in Oklahoma City Thunder \\x13 AND, seeing Adele live in concert \\x13 she brought the house down!\\nQ: What are your hobbies?\\nA: Watching NBA League Pass, reading, travel, and spending time with my family.\\nQ: Favorite technology purchase in the last 5 years\\nA: Sonos \\x13 Music is the soundtrack to your life and the ability to fill your house with those sounds at the touch of a button is amazing. Also, they do it in an incredibly simple way.\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nThanks Junior!       \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'Die Digitalisierung als Wachstums- und Entwicklungstreiber zieht sich bereits heute durch fast alle Branchen und Anwendungsgebiete, sei es im Finanzbereich, der Industrie oder eben auch im Bereich Healthcare.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAuch wenn nicht jedes Gesch\\xef\\xbf\\xbdftsmodell von Disruption bzw. Digital Darwinismus bedroht ist, bieten neue Technologien Potenziale f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr mehr Effizienz, bessere Prozesse und zur Kostenersparnis. Im Bereich der Gesundheitsversorgung in Krankenh\\xef\\xbf\\xbdusern ist dieser Aspekt ein besonders wichtiger. Durch die Festlegung von Fallpauschalen und Sonderentgelten besteht ein hoher Kostendruck. Der Bedarf an mehr Effizienz durch Digitalisierung bleibt nicht nur w\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnschenswert, er ist zwingend notwendig. Damit das gelingt, ist der Einsatz von geeigneten interoperablen L\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsungen entscheidend. Das Thema mit dem h\\xef\\xbf\\xbdchsten Potenzial aber auch mit den meisten Hindernissen wird seit Jahren intensiv diskutiert: Die elektronische Patientenakte (ePA)\\nStatus Quo\\nAnaloge Prozesse\\nIn Deutschland liegen Patientendaten in internen Systemen vor \\x13 Sei es in Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) oder im Praxisverwaltungssystem (PVS) niedergelassener \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrzte. Auch die Dokumentation von weiteren Befunden ist in der Regel ein manueller Vorgang. Zwischen einzelnen Leistungserbringern werden Patienteninformationen, Befunde, R\\xef\\xbf\\xbdntgenbilder teils digital, z.B. durch einrichtungsinterne Informationssysteme, aber auch analog in Form der Fieberkurve in der Behandlungskette weitergereicht. Handschriftliche Dokumentationen und postalischer Versand und Empfang sind fehleranf\\xef\\xbf\\xbdllig. Behandelnde Mediziner sind dabei nicht immer auf dem aktuellsten Stand, erhalten wichtige Patientendaten gar nicht oder zu sp\\xef\\xbf\\xbdt und m\\xef\\xbf\\xbdssen Zeit f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr die Konsultation mit Kollegen aufwenden. Langwierige Behandlungszeitr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdume aber auch doppelt gef\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhrte oder unvollst\\xef\\xbf\\xbdndige Patientenakten sind die Folge. Durch unn\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtige \\xef\\xbf\\xbdberbehandlung und Dokumentation sowie Behandlungsfehler entstehen so j\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhrlich Kosten in Milliardenh\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhe.\\nEinrichtungs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbergreifende Intransparenzen\\nAufgrund des medizinischen Fortschritts sind Behandlungszentren und Einrichtungen aber auch die einzelnen Berufsgruppen im Gesundheitswesen hochdifferenziert. Je nach Diagnose und Krankheitsbild werden Untersuchungen und Therapien f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr Patienten in arbeitsteiligen, teils parallel ablaufenden Prozessen und \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber mehrere Fachkliniken, Fachbereiche und Akteure abgebildet. Die so entstehenden Versorgungsketten sind zwischen den Einrichtungen nur lose bis gar nicht verzahnt, so dass es zu Br\\xef\\xbf\\xbdchen in der Informationskette und Intransparenzen kommt. Das unzureichende oder fehlende Wissen \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber den aktuellen Behandlungs- und Gesundheitsstatus eines Patienten erschwert die weitere Behandlung und wirkt sich negativ auf die Patientensicherheit und die Kosteneffizenz der Leistungserbringer aus. Durch fehlende Interoperabilit\\xef\\xbf\\xbdt zwischen den unterschiedlichen Informationssystemen sind Gesundheitseinrichtungen, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrzte und Patienten digital voneinander entkoppelt.\\nDer Patient als Informationsquelle und -Verteiler\\nDurch die fehlende Synchronisation von Patientendaten zwischen verschiedenen Einrichtungen in der Versorgungskette kommt dem Patienten eine besondere Rolle als Informations\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbermittler zu. Einerseits muss er m\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglichst l\\xef\\xbf\\xbdckenlos \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber seine bisherige Krankengeschichte (je nach Fall \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber mehrere Jahre in die Vergangenheit) berichten k\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnnen aber auch medizinisches Fachpersonal hinsichtlich bestehender Vorerkrankungen, Medikation, Unvertr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglichkeiten, Allergien, etc. aufkl\\xef\\xbf\\xbdren k\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnnen. Gerade bei \\xef\\xbf\\xbdlteren oder geistig beeintr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdchtigten Patienten sind Informationsl\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcken oft unvermeidlich. Zus\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtzlich werden Dokumente wie Arztbriefe oder Ergebnisse aus bildgebenden Verfahren dem Patienten bei der Entlassung/\\xef\\xbf\\xbdberstellung pers\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnlich mitgegeben. Damit tr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdgt der Patient auch selbst ein unn\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtig hohes Ma\\xef\\xbf\\xbd an Verantwortung f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr einen optimalen Behandlungsverlauf und dessen Dauer.\\nDie elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) soll diesen Herausforderungen begegnen und bildet aktuell das Kernthema in deutschen Krankenh\\xef\\xbf\\xbdusern und Pflegeeinrichtungen\\xef\\xbf\\xbdin puncto Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens.\\nDie elektronische Patientenakte \\x13 viele Modelle und kaum Vernetzung\\nAktuelle Situation\\nBereits 2004 mit dem GKV-Modernisierungsgesetz wurde die ePA als eine der Anwendungen der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte (eGK) genannt. Seit dem wurde mehr als eine Milliarde Euro in das Projekt investiert und noch immer nutzen Patienten in Deutschland keine elektronische Gesundheitskarte.\\nIn dem 2015 verabschiedeten E-Health-Gesetz wurde die ePA als wesentlicher Teil der k\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnftigen Telematikinfrastruktur (TI) genannt. Die TI, welche von der Betriebsgesellschaft gematik entwickelt wird, soll dabei das digitale Kommunikationsnetz und die Grundlage f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr die ePA und das elektronische Patientenfach bilden. Bis zum 01.01.2019 sollen alle \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrzte, Psychotherapeuten, Krankenh\\xef\\xbf\\xbduser und anderen Akteure des Gesundheitswesens daran angebunden sein.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nLaut Gesetz soll die ePA den Not\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfall\\xef\\xbf\\xbddaten\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsatz, den Medikationsplan, Arztbriefe und weitere medizinische Dokumente, wie etwa den elektronischen Impfpass, aufnehmen.\\nAnders als das ebenfalls vorgesehene ePF, erfordert die ePA als Zugriffsberechtigung den elektronischen Heilberufsausweis des behandelnden Arztes. Im ePF wiederrum sollen dem Versicherten die Inhalte seiner Patientenakte in ein sogenanntes Patientenfach gespiegelt werden, damit der Patient auch unabh\\xef\\xbf\\xbdngig von einem Arztbesuch darauf zugreifen kann. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber die Daten der Akte hinaus, soll der Patient hier auch die M\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglichkeit erhalten, pers\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnliche Gesundheitsdaten einzutragen.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nMit einheitlichen Standards und Spezifikationen sollen Insell\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsungen vermieden werden. Im E-Health Gesetz ist davon allerdings nichts zu lesen. Daf\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr existierten heute bereits parallel verschiedene gesetzliche Grundlagen zur Umsetzung von elektronischen Akten:\\n\\nIn \\xef\\xbf\\xbd 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 4 SGB V - elektronische Patientenakte\\nin \\xef\\xbf\\xbd 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 5 SGB V - elektronisches Patientenfach\\nin \\xef\\xbf\\xbd 68 SGB V - elektronische Gesundheitsakte\\nin \\xef\\xbf\\xbd 630f BGB \\x13 elektronische Arztakte\\n\\nMilliardenschwere Digitalprojekte auf Basis von confusion-by-design haben es schwer. Daher ist es auch nicht verwunderlich, dass bereits ein E-Health Gesetz II in Arbeit ist. In der Zwischenzeit haben bereits einige Versicherer Ihre eigenen Pilotprojekte in Betrieb genommen. Nat\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrlich mit unterschiedliche Strategien und mit unterschiedlichen Varianten der elektronischen Patientenakte.\\nVarianten von Patientenakten\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\nEinrichtungs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbergreifende Patientenakte (eEPA) Bei diesem Konzept werden alle Informationen die bei der Behandlungen eines Patienten anfallen f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr Gesundheitsversorgungseinrichtungen fall\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbergreifend hinweg bereitgestellt. Eintragungen erfolgen ausschlie\\xef\\xbf\\xbdlich \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrzte und \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhnliche Behandlungsmitglieder. Die Akte wird dauerhaft gef\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhrt, so dass eine gesamtheitliche Versorgung des Patienten \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber alle bisherigen oder bestehenden Krankheiten m\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglich ist. Eintr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdge k\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnnen von Leistungserbringern \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber ein Portal oder \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber das Prim\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrsystem heraus an die eEPA \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbermittelt werden \\x13 Die Interoperabilit\\xef\\xbf\\xbdt zwischen den Systemen vorausgesetzt. Die eEPA sieht abseits von der Datenfreigabe keine Einsicht oder Mitwirkung durch den Patienten selbst vor.\\n\\n\\n\\nElektronische Fallakte (eFA)Die eFA ist \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrztlich gef\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhrt und moderiert. Sie wird einrichtungs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbergreifend eingesetzt und ausschlie\\xef\\xbf\\xbdlich fallbezogen gef\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhrt. Die eFA hat zum Ziel, eine optimale Koordination der Versorgung in den einzelnen Behandlungseinrichtungen zu erm\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglichen. Im Gegensatz zur eEPA wird sie nach Fallabschluss geschlossen, der Lebenszyklus der Akte f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdllt dementsprechend kurz aus. Die Daten in der eFA werden \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber die Prim\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrsysteme zur Verf\\xef\\xbf\\xbdgung gestellt. Auch hier gibt der Patient seine Einwilligung \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber die Datennutzung generell, ein Zugriff auf Patientenseite findet nicht statt.\\n\\n\\nPers\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnliche, einrichtungs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbergreifende Gesundheits- und\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPatientenakte (PEPA)Dieses Konzept bindet den Patienten bei der Bereitstellung, Einsicht und Freigabe von Gesundheitsdaten aktiv mit ein. \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber ein Patientenportal hat der Patient die M\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglichkeit z.B. Arztbriefe selbstst\\xef\\xbf\\xbdndig einzustellen (Patienten-Selbstmanagement). Auch hat der Patient die M\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglichkeit selbst zu bestimmen, welche Daten in der Akte gespeichert werden und wer darauf Zugriff haben soll. Die PEPA ist wie die ePA eine fall\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbergreifende bzw. lebenslange Akte und wird sowohl vom Patienten als auch \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrzten dezentral oder \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber angebundene Prim\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrsysteme gepflegt.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\n\\n\\nElektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA) Die elektronische Gesundheitsakte wird h\\xef\\xbf\\xbdufig mit der elektronischen Patientenakte gleichgesetzt. Da letztere aber bis auf die PEPA rein \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrztlich gef\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhrt ist, ist die eGA so ausgelegt, dass der Patient alleiniger Herr seiner Daten ist und diese beliebig anreichern kann. Versicherte sollen selbst entscheiden k\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnnen, welche Diagnosen oder Medikamente sie darauf speichern m\\xef\\xbf\\xbdchten und wem sie Einsicht gew\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhren wollen. Voraussetzung ist, dass die eGA das Erheben, Verarbeiten und Nutzen von Daten \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber Befunde, Diagnosen, Therapien, Behandlungsberichte sowie Impfungen f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr eine fall- und einrichtungs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbergreifende Dokumentation \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber den Patienten unterst\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtzt\\n\\nTechnische Standards\\nAus der Notwendigkeit einer einheitlichen Kommunikation und der Herstellung von Interoperabilit\\xef\\xbf\\xbdt, haben sich verschiedene Standards entwickelt, die den technischen Kontext f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr elektronische Patientenakten bilden.\\n\\nIntegrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHR)IHE ist eine internationale, gemeinn\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtzige Initiative aus Industrie und Fachanwendern, die sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat, die Interoperabilit\\xef\\xbf\\xbdt zwischen IT-Systemen im Gesundheitswesen sicherzustellen. Die von IHE entwickelten Standards (IHE-Profile) unterst\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtzen eine Vielzahl klinischer Prozesse und enthalten auch optionale Funktionen und sind bestimmten Dom\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnen z.B. f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr Augenheilkunde, Radiologie, Technische Infrastruktur, etc. zugeordnet. F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr den Einsatz von elektronischen Patientenakten ist das IHE Profil XDS (Cross-Enterprise Dokument Sharing) hervorzuheben, welches eine standardisierte Spezifikation f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr die gemeinsame, einrichtungs\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbergreifende Nutzung von Dokumenten beschreibt.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\n\\nHL7 HL7 ist, \\xef\\xbf\\xbdhnlich wie IHR, eine internationale Gruppe, die einheitliche Standards f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr den Datenaustausch zwischen verschiedenen Gesundheitsinstitutionen- und Systemen entwickelt. Die entwickelten Normen haben die Interoperabilit\\xef\\xbf\\xbdt von verschiedenen Herstellern und Betreibern zum Ziel z.B. zwischen Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) und Praxisverwaltungssystemen (PVS) niedergelassener \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrzte. Der aktuellste Standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) vereinigt die Vorteile der etablierten HL7-Standard-Produktlinien und aktuellen Web-Standards (z.B. XML, JSON, ATOM, HTTPS, OAuth) und legt Wert auf einfache Implementierbarkeit und unterst\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtzt die Entwicklung von mobile und cloud-basierte Anwendungen.\\nDICOM\\xef\\xbf\\xbd DICOM\\xef\\xbf\\xbd steht f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine und ist der internationale Standard zum \\xef\\xbf\\xbdbertragen, Speichern, Abrufen, Drucken, Verarbeiten und Anzeigen von medizinischen Bildinformationen. Die meisten Hersteller von Systeme f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr bildgebende Verfahren wie R\\xef\\xbf\\xbdntgen, MRT, CT haben den Standard in ihren Produkten implementiert. Dadurch wird eine hohe Interoperabilit\\xef\\xbf\\xbdt im Umfeld verschiedener Gesundheitseinrichtungen erm\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglicht. DICOM bildet auch die Grundlage f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr die digitale Bildarchivierungsystemen sog. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS).\\n\\nAktuelle Praxisbeispiele\\nVivy-App\\nDie vom gleichnamigen Unternehmen entwickelte App \\x1eVivy\\x1c wurde in Kooperation von 90 gesetzlichen Krankenkassen und vier privaten Krankenversicherungen auf den Weg gebracht. Die in einem deutschen Rechenzentrum gespeicherten Daten sind Ende-zu-Ende verschl\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsselt und k\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnnen \\xef\\xbf\\xbdber ein gekoppeltes Smartphone mit 2-Faktor-Authentifizierung vom Patienten eingesehen werden. Die App erm\\xef\\xbf\\xbdglicht den Upload von medizinischen Daten und Dokumenten. Die App soll nicht nur die Gesundheitsakte sondern zudem den Impfpass, den Medikationsplan, Notfalldaten, einen\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Gesundheits-Check sowie eine Arztsuche beinhalten. Mittels Barcode-Scan von Medikamenten sollen auch m\\xef\\xbf\\xbdgliche Wechselwirkungen aufgezeigt werden. Da die App das DICOM-Format beherrscht, k\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnnen auch Daten wie aus bildgebenden Verfahren importiert werden. Der Patient entscheidet, welche Informationen er mit \\xef\\xbf\\xbdrzten und Gesundheitseinrichtungen teilt und kann auch Dokumente l\\xef\\xbf\\xbdschen. Beim Verlust des Schl\\xef\\xbf\\xbdssel sind die Daten allerdings unwiederbringlich verloren. Vivy soll als pers\\xef\\xbf\\xbdnliche Gesundheitsassistent-App f\\xef\\xbf\\xbdr 25 Mio. Versicherte kostenfrei zur Verf\\xef\\xbf\\xbdgung gestellt werden.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell sharply on Tuesday on oversupply concerns, while a gauge of stocks across the globe rose for a seventh straight session after large overnight gains in Asia. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., November 18, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index was little changed, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell and the Nasdaq rose, all having hit record intraday highs earlier in the session. Traders cited the lingering uncertainty over whether the United States and China could agree to end a near 1-1/2 year trade war as a reason for stocks to drift and bond prices to go higher. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal is reached with Beijing to end the trade war. The next round of tariffs is due to start in mid-December. Oil fell after sources told Reuters that Russia is unlikely to agree to cut its oil output further at a meeting with fellow exporters next month. Separately, Norway\\x19s October oil production beat forecasts and the potential oversupply, combined with some worries over global demand next year, sent prices lower. \\x1cMoreover, Russia also failed to fulfill its agreed cuts in November so far,\\x1d Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 3.38% to $55.12 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $60.73, down 2.74% on the day. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 102.2 points, or 0.36%, to 27,934.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.85 points, or 0.06%, to 3,120.18 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.72 points, or 0.24%, to 8,570.66. Hopes of a trade truce earlier in the day drove European stocks to a four-year high and a measure of world stock markets to their highest in nearly two years, but those gains were pared later in the session. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.12% while MSCI\\x19s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02% eking out its seventh straight session of gains. Emerging market stocks rose 0.48%. MSCI\\x19s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.68% higher, while Japan\\x19s Nikkei futures NKc1 lost 0.66%. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields slipped as risk appetite weakened. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.786%, down from 1.808% late on Monday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 29/32 in price to yield 2.252%, from 2.293% late on Monday. The dollar was little changed against a basket of six major currencies. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.05%, with the euro EUR= up 0.05% to $1.1075. While the dollar was supported by recent U.S. economic data meeting lowered expectations, the greenback may be in for some weakness, said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc. \\x1cCentral banks cannot provide that much to incentivize stocks any higher, thus risk-appetite is muted and the buck may continue to lose based on the fact that the American economy is indeed slower and the Fed\\x19s ability to satisfy anyone is in question,\\x1d Perez said. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback at 108.55 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2925, down 0.21% on the day. Spot gold XAU= added 0.1% to $1,472.19 an ounce. Copper CMCU3 rose 0.86% to $5,880.00 a tonne. Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 lost 0.06% to $1,737.00 a tonne.

But this can sometimes lead to alarm fatigue, with care givers being exposed to up to 1,000 alarms per shift[1], even though up to 99% of those do not even require clinical intervention[2].\\nThe new alarm management solution called Digistat Patient Watch, collects data from a variety of devices connected to the patient providing a holistic view at the patient bedside level and at the ICU level. Clinicians gain visibility on patient status, highlighting alarms and warnings occurring on any connected device. This critical data can also be displayed on a handheld mobile device, such as the Ascom Myco 2 which is designed specifically for clinical staff. The benefits for healthcare professionals may include helping improve staff efficiency, supporting better organization of patient care and implementing procedures to reduce the number of alarms.\\n\\x1cDigistat Patient Watch helps clinicians leverage patient data to increase situational awareness and align priorities. It has the potential to change their practice and improve workflow efficiency\\x1d says Andr\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Neu, Head of Platform Solutions for Ascom.\\n\\x1cDigistat Patient Watch is an important addition to GE Healthcare\\x19s portfolio of solutions for the Intensive Care, and we are delighted with this expanded collaboration with Ascom\\x1d, adds Olivier Bosc, General Manager of Life Care Solutions Europe at GE Healthcare.\\nFor more information on the Digistat Patient Watch solution, as well as on Ascom\\x19s innovative clinical care solutions, please visit: www.ascom.com\\n[1] Alarm fatigue: impacts on patient safety, Ruskin KJ, Hueske-Kraus D.

(AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The Latest on a deadly stabbing on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train (all times local):  10 p.m.  Authorities say a stabbing that killed a passenger on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train may have occurred after the attacker tried to steal another rider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoes.  The fight broke out Tuesday afternoon on a BART train pulling into a station in Hayward.  The San Francisco Chronicle says police are looking into whether the victim was a good Samaritan who tried to stop the suspect from stealing items from another person, possibly shoes.   The man ran from the station. The Chronicle says he was arrested a block away after employees of a car dealership said he tried to steal a van.  Employee Steve Castro tells the paper that he fought with the shirtless man, who snatched the keys from his hand as he was showing the van to a customer.      ___  4:14 p.m.  A California transit chief says a man has been stabbed to death on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train during a fight.  Interim BART Police Chief Ed Alvarez told reporters at a news conference that officials began receiving 911 calls Tuesday afternoon about a fight aboard a train between two men.  He says transit officers boarded the train at the next stop and found a man bleeding, who was possibly the victim of a stabbing. He says the man died.  Alvarez says transit officers quickly searched the area and were able to apprehend a suspect.  He said there is no threat to the public because it was a fight between two people who engaged each other.   Officials did not immediately provide any other details.  \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'\\nHong Kong is burning. The authorities continue to pour fuel on the fire. On Monday, the People\\x19s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, warned that there is \\x1cabsolutely no room for compromise\\x1d. But it is not merely that Beijing and the Hong Kong government will not take a step back; they continue to escalate the crisis.\\nAs the newspaper commentary was published, Hong Kong Polytechnic University was besieged by police, who fired round after round of teargas at protesters attempting to flee the scene. The message \\x13 no way out \\x13 was all the more disturbing given that officers had earlier threatened to use live fire if petrol bombs or weaponry were used against them again. Among the hundreds trapped were said to be secondary school pupils. Parents, lawmakers and a bishop who sought to talk to protesters and seek some kind of resolution were prevented from doing so, though the former head of Hong Kong\\x19s legislative council was later allowed to enter. When tens of thousands more residents launched \\x1csave the students\\x1d marches converging upon the campus, they too faced rubber bullets and teargas, in some cases after people threw petrol bombs.\\nExcessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement, and persuading a large section of the population that they should support it. The withdrawal of the bill was far too little, too late. Meanwhile, banning most rallies has closed off a peaceful avenue for challenging authorities.\\nThough many remain peaceful, a radical minority of protesters have responded with unacceptable violence. Many in Hong Kong will deplore that decision and were rightly repelled when a man was set on fire last week, apparently by a protester. Another man died after he was hit by a brick during a clash between protesters and police. But a large proportion of the population still blames those in power for this crisis, and it is likely that more stand by the cause: defending Hong Kong\\x19s way of life, safeguarded in theory until 2047, but dramatically eroded in recent years. Meanwhile, they note that the People\\x19s Liberation Army took to the city\\x19s streets to clear barricades this weekend: a \\x1cvoluntary clean-up activity\\x1d which acted as a reminder that the Chinese military could yet be called in, and which many saw as an attempt to normalise their presence.\\nThe movement\\x19s resolve in Hong Kong is also a response to events on the mainland: the increasing repression seen under Xi Jinping, most of all in Xinjiang. As government documents leaked to the New York Times have unveiled, the mass detention of a million or more Uighurs and other minorities originated in directives from Xi to \\x1cshow absolutely no mercy\\x1d in the \\x1cstruggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism\\x1d. Many in Hong Kong fear that to pause or seek compromise is to surrender entirely. Further repression in the region will provoke the kind of ongoing resistance, even insurgency, that some have called the \\x1cBelfastisation\\x1d of the city.\\nFurther afield, the crisis has boosted, to Beijing\\x19s chagrin, the prospects of Taiwan\\x19s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive party, as she faces next year\\x19s election. And the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, under consideration by the US Senate on Monday, would impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses.\\nChina\\x19s leaders may still believe all this is a price worth paying. Since 1989, when it crushed the pro-reform protests that began in Tiananmen Square, and witnessed the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, Beijing has calculated that bloody suppression should be avoided if possible \\x13 but not by offering concessions. It will angrily dismiss any criticism, as it has that from Britain. Ignored or not, foreign leaders have a duty to remind China that they are watching.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'The big iFixit teardown is done, and the results are in. The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a heck of a lot like the old 15-inch MacBook Pro, save for a few meaningful throwback features. Yes, I mean throwback as in retro\\x14as in Apple actually took retired features from old MacBooks and reintroduced them as new features. It would seem that the future of innovation at the Cupertino-based computer company is what I\\x19ll call rewind design.I\\x19m not complaining. The 16-inch MacBook Pro looks like a hell of a laptop, as it should for a starting price of $2,400. The new machine comes with a bigger display, a bigger battery, better speakers, and a brand new AMD graphics card. Then there are those retro features. There\\x19s a physical escape button just like there was on MacBook Pros before the rise of the Touch Bar. The arrow keys are once again arranged in an inverted \\x1cT\\x1d formation, as they had been on keyboards for decades. The new \\x1cMagic Keyboard\\x1d uses a scissor switch that\\x19s almost identical to the Bluetooth-enabled Magic Keyboard that Apple released nearly five years ago. The keyboard thing is a big deal. Apple has been dealing with public outrage sparked by its newer butterfly mechanism in MacBook keyboards. This low-travel design contributed to the impossible thinness of the 12-inch MacBook released in 2015, before finding its way into all MacBook models in 2016. Even a small bit of dust or debris could disable a key, and fixing it required replacing the entire upper half of the laptop. Apple admitted to the flawed design and launched a limited repair program in June 2018, before it ultimately offered free keyboard repairs for all MacBooks with the new mechanism. The company was still trying to fix the scissor design as recently as May of this year when it launched an updated 15-inch MacBook Pro. Now, the cursed butterfly-powered MacBook keyboard is all but dead. The new keyboard design is expected to show up on smaller MacBooks in early 2020.But the new design isn\\x19t all that new. As iFixit points out in its teardown, the 16-inch MacBook\\x19s keyboard is virtually identical to the well-loved Magic Keyboard from 2o15. In other words, Apple replaced a flawed design from 2015\\x14one that it had tried and failed to perfect many times\\x14with a design from 2015 that wasn\\x19t so flawed. It\\x19s almost as if Apple made the wrong decision almost five years ago, and in order to deal with that, it\\x19s just going back in time and making the right decision. The same is true for the new physical escape button, which Apple had axed on most MacBook Pro models in 2016, and for the new inverted \\x1cT\\x1d arrow key layout, which Apple had done away with back in 2015.Photo: iFixitThis is a curious way to design computers. It also seems like Apple\\x19s MacBook team was really screwing up back in 2015. That was a time when the company\\x19s design team decided to fix a few things that weren\\x19t broken and break a few more things in the process. Now, to fix those problems, Apple is just replacing the broken new things with near-identical versions of the old things, effectively putting its design process in reverse. If you liked the crispiness and ease of the newer scissor mechanism on the big MacBook Pro, too bad. Apple failed at perfecting its promising design so it just switched back to the old one.Once again,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdI\\x19m not complaining. As one of the many thousands of people with broken MacBook keyboards, I welcome the return of the more robust design of the Magic Keyboard. I have one of the old Magic Keyboards on my desk, and I love it! I especially love how the keys don\\x19t break constantly. And while we\\x19re on the topic, I also miss having an escape key. My 15-inch MacBook Pro has a Touch Bar, which I hate\\x14although I would hate it slightly less if it had a physical escape key. I\\x19m honestly impartial on the inverted \\x1cT\\x1d arrow key thing, but I know some people are passionate about it.What does bug me about Apple\\x19s new take on innovation is that it confirms the belief that the company seldom has new ideas. I wrote a long rant about this last year when it was apparent that Apple focuses less on hardware innovation and more on money-making services. That prediction, unfortunately, turned out to be true. In recent months, we\\x19ve seen the release of a new iPhone, which amounted to the old iPhone plus an extra camera, as well as the new Apple TV+ streaming service, which is a bit bland. They\\x19re not bad products. But they\\x19re certainly not groundbreaking.The same appears to be true for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. I\\x19ll reserve final judgment until I\\x19ve had time to test the new laptop, and given my penchant for an operational keyboard and an escape key, I bet I\\x19ll like it. I just can\\x19t stop wondering if I\\x19ll ever see another new Apple product that warps my understanding of technology the way that the iPod or the iPhone did so many years ago. It\\x19s possible that Apple will do it with some sort of augmented reality headset in the next couple of years.

        "articleBody": "b\"  (Image: gargantiopa / Getty Images)  As the year comes to an end, it's time to sit back and reflect. This year we saw Samsung almost fold the Fold, the Motorola Razr make a comeback, and Apple impresses with the iPhone 11's camera. We also saw gadgets from tech companies, large and small, that made a splash over the past year.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAlso: See Black Friday coverage at CNETSurely, as we head into the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, along with the many promotions we'll see before the holidays arrive, so be sure to keep on an eye out for the best deals.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdSome of 2019's best tech gadgetsDisclosure:\\xef\\xbf\\xbdZDNet\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmay earn a commission from some of the products featured on this page. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Apple AirPods Pro for $235Since the AirPods first launched in 2016, users and critics alike have been asking for noise cancellation and replaceable tips for a better fit. Apple finally delivered all of that and then some with the new AirPods Pro. The new design sounds better, will drown out background noise in noisy environments, and comes with three different sized tips to ensure you get the right fit. Nintendo Nintendo Switch Lite for $200 The smaller, more portable Nintendo Switch gives up the ability to slide into a dock and game on your TV, but it gains battery life and fun new colors. The screen has been shrunk to 5.5-inches, and the Joy-Cons are permanently attached to the device. But outside of that, it's still the same old Switch that users love and embrace.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Sonos Sonos Move for $400Sonos speakers have long been considered some of the best home entertainment speakers available, but they all had one problem -- they weren't portable. With Sonos Move, the company created a speaker that sounds as good as the rest of its lineup, but it's completely portable. You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Apple's AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close the nearest power outlet is.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Amazon Amazon Echo Buds for $130In many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds. Amazon's Echo Buds have been well received and cost far less than Apple's AirPods Pro. The earbuds have Alexa built-in, have active noise cancellation, and work with iOS and Android devices.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Apple, Inc. Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfor $999The iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn't supposed to blow us away, but that's exactly what it did. Apple not only caught up with its camera features, but it's done an amazing job with new features like Night Mode. Then there's the fact that battery life on the 11 Pro Max is simply the best on any phone you can get this year.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for $840Arguably the best Android phone of 2019, the Note 10 Plus is well designed, has a long list of features and capabilities, and is powerful enough to keep up with whatever you throw at it. It has plenty of cameras to harness your creativity, and, of course, it has that S-Pen that users know and love.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd DJI DJI Mavic Mini for $399The Mavic Mini is the ideal combination of a capable drone in a small package. With a range of up to 4km and battery life of 30 minutes, it's pretty hard to believe it's priced at $399. It's perfect for those new to drones and enthusiasts who love shiny new things.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Fossil Fossil Hybrid HR smartwatch for $195The Fossil Hybrid HR is billed as a smartwatch, but could easily pass as a normal watch. Underneath the physical watch hands is an energy-efficient display that sips on battery yet still provides notifications from your connected phone, as well as weather and calendar details.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Wyze Wyze Sense Starter Kit for $20Know when a window or door opens, or whenever there's motion in the hallway with the Wyze Sense starter kit. You'll need one of Wyze's security cameras to connect it all to the internet, but those are just as cheap as this kit.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Amazon Amazon Echo Dot with clock for $45One of my top requests to Amazon's Alexa is to ask for the current time. The new Echo Dot with a clock eliminates that by adding a small digital clock to the side. You can still ask for the time, of course, or use Alexa to control connected devices, ask questions or play music.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Ring Ring Indoor Cam for $60Ring security cameras are some of the best, but up until now, they'd all been made primarily for outdoor use. The new indoor camera is affordable and capable of helping you monitor your home.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdLet's be honest, distilling down the past year's worth of gadget launches into a shortlist is hard.

        "articleBody": "b' Even if its core components are owed to other games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order finds a reason for their inclusion and stops just short of greatness. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is game that is many things to different people. You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.\\nIt\\x19s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it\\x19s even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.\\nWhere it\\x19s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.\\nFallen Order\\x19s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game\\x19s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era\\x19s biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.\\nOne of the narrative\\x19s strongest elements is that it doesn\\x19t rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There\\x19s one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn\\x19t matter to the general story.\\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez\\x19s ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year\\x19s best new character. \\nI have to give special attention to his voice direction \\x13 and my god, every little animation he plays \\x13 both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial robots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2\\x19s BT-7274.\\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn\\x19t so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\\n\\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\\nThis means you\\x19ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn\\x19t shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don\\x19t always need to follow the quest marker if you don\\x19t want to.\\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it\\x19s great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.\\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It\\x19s not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware\\x19s work, which is what makes the map \\x13 available to you at any point \\x13 such a lifesaver.\\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren\\x19t. They\\x19re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It\\x19s a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake\\x19s map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn\\x19t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.\\nIn your adventures, you\\x19ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they\\x19re often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however \\x13 units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they\\x19re mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.\\n\\n\\nThe best new character in 2019.\\n\\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\\nYou\\x19re going to parry the basic trooper\\x19s bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You\\x19ll watch for the melee trooper\\x19s very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you\\x19ll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you\\x19ll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious. \\nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you\\x19re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.\\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\\nFallen Order\\x19s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules. You don\\x19t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.\\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you\\x19ll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It\\x19s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution. \\nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you\\x19ll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it\\x19s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There\\x19s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents\\x19 guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry. \\nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can\\x19t cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don\\x19t really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They\\x19ll often continue their combo unabated and you\\x19ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren\\x19t working.\\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn\\x19t fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack. \\nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could\\x19ve soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn\\x19t hook me. \\n\\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all \\x13 at the game\\x19s worst moments \\x13 lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually \\x13 but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren\\x19t enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I\\x19ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don\\x19t always win. \\nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting \\x13 but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.\\nAnd yes, it doesn\\x19t always get there in this one, but damn If I can\\x19t help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It\\x19s worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn\\x19t settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent \\x13 albeit flawed \\x13 combat.\\nVersion tested: PC.\\n\\n\\n   Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

        "articleBody": "b' The equity benchmark Sensex scaled a new all-time high of 40,816.38 in the morning trade on November 20. Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been rallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with macroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.Why is the market behaving differently from the economy?\"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three positive indicators for growth \\x13 reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed divestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-China trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we expect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities.Experts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a recovery in the economy.\"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a reasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities.A key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.The September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of the companies reported in-line or better than expected results.Tax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The key positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front (sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely neutral, say experts.\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate tax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.For the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the concerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.Bank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza attributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court\\'s ruling on the Essar Steel resolution.\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should be seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in bidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will be high now,\" said Oza.Global financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the Essar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured banks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.Near-term consolidation likelyHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don\\'t grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.\"The hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings should not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several structural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or investment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the high government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.An extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent revival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.Coming back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the market and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is a stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the benchmark.\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally. So far, it looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.The valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.The Indian market\\x19s high valuations are being supported by a combination of factors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a China-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street\\'s expectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the market\\x19s expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and strong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional Equities said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

        "articleBody": "b'Welcome to the new 16-inch MacBook Pro. While it looks quite familiar, Apple\\'s new flagship laptop moves the needle forward in a big way. We\\'ve spent the last several days taking the new Pro for a spin and can say that Apple has dutifully listened to users\\' feedback this time around. Let\\'s talk about it.Apple\\'s 16-inch MacBook Pro\\nWe\\'re not certain when Apple last issued four updates to the MacBook Pro within 18 months, or to any laptop it has ever produced. But, here we are.\\nJust months after the last i9 MacBook Pro was released, Apple has unveiled its 16-inch MacBook Pro. The surface changes aren\\'t even obvious \\x14 the monitor is about a half an inch larger on the diagonal, and you can\\'t even tell that the machine is larger than the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro design.\\nInterestingly, it is actually smaller and thinner than the 2012 through 2015 model. You also can\\'t tell unless you\\'re looking at the three together.Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTube\\nThere are three main configurations of the 15-inch MacBook Pro, one with a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 processor, a 2.3GHz i9 model, and a 2.4GHz i9 configuration \\x14effectively the same options as the 15-inch MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019. Depending on model, there are options for a AMD Radeon Pro 5300M or 5500M. For this review, we\\'re examining the 2.4GHz 16-inch MacBook Pro, with 512GB of flash storage, 32GB of RAM, and the Radeon Pro 5500M. The retail price on this configuration is $3,299.16-inches instead of 15.4\\nThis will matter to you a great deal, or it won\\'t, and even before you started reading this, you already knew if it mattered to you or not. In our eyes, there are more important aspects to the 16-inch MacBook Pro redesign than the screen, though.\\nWhat we will say, is if you are staring at a 15-inch MacBook Pro right next to the 16-inch MacBook Pro you will notice a difference. The updated design looks better with slimmer bezels and an ever-so-slightly elevated pixel density going from 220 to 226ppi. That likely won\\'t be a huge reason for users to upgrade though.The slimmer bezels of the 16-inch MacBook Pro\\nPros out there who are well-versed in the video space will appreciate one change to the display though, which is the ability to specifically choose your refresh rate. Heading to System Preferences, multiple options can be chosen from to best align with your work.Keyboard\\nKeyboards are highly subjective. So highly subjective, in fact, that even if you like a mechanical keyboard, there are dozens of different iterations, with different key feels because assorted manufacturers believe that there is that much granularity in demand.\\nSo, a little context is important. We\\'re not giant fans of typing on glass, like the iPad. We didn\\'t have a problem with the butterfly keyboard that was introduced with the 2016 MacBook Pro \\x14 but it wasn\\'t a favorite of ours. Inverted \\'T\\' design for arrow keys\\nWe get that the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard design, and iterations, are polarizing. Where the 2012 through 2015 design had the entire expression of keyboard like and hate, the 2016 through 2019 weighed more heavily on the \"it\\'ll do\" to \"this is terrible\" range, with very, very few folks in the \"this is great\" zone.\\nIn regards to reliability, across the entire AppleInsider staff, exactly one unit had to be replaced. We had the same failure rate with the 2012 through 2015 keyboard. And, the data we\\'ve been collecting on the 2018 model and the mid-2019 refresh suggests that whatever Apple did for reliability is working, with it having an equivalent failure rate in the first year to the 2012 through 2015 design.\\nBeyond looking back, the key actuation on the 16-inch MacBook Pro is punctuated by a soft click, most similar to the mid-2019 noise versus any other, if a bit quieter. Where the 2015 design noise was more from the key bottoming out the switch, if you press slowly, you can feel where the click is on the new computer, before hitting the bottom of the chamber. Gone is the clackety-clack of the original 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard, and you\\'ll never mistake this keyboard for a desktop mechanical model.\\nThere\\'s more sensory data on the keys in the video that accompanies this piece. But, here are the numbers: the key travel on the 16-inch MacBook Pro keyboard is one millimeter. This is in comparison to between 0.6 and 0.7 millimeters on the 2016-style keyboard, and between 1.2 and 1.5 millimeters on the 2012 through 2015 style.Typing on the new MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard\\nIn our testing, we had a baseline of 38 dBa of ambient noise measured with a Kanomax model 4431 audiometer, with the test gear at head height and distance. Typing on the 2016 MacBook Pro with no other CPU load brought that up to about 43 dBa. The highest we could manage on the 16-inch MacBook pro with a particularly angry bout of random key-mashing was 41 dBa. Quieter indeed.\\nWith that 2016 redesign, Apple made a big deal about key stability being an underpinning of the design. In short, the new keyboard is more key travel than the 2016, but less than the 2012. Whatever Apple did for key stability in the 2016 was moved to the 16-inch MacBook pro \\x14 and this is a good thing. And, Apple tells us that individual keys can be replaced. We didn\\'t get any information on what this entails, but at this juncture, it still looks like a complete disassembly is required to do so.Touch Bar and Escape Key\\nThe new keyboard on the 16-inch MacBook Pro has a physical escape key, and instead of the Touch ID sensor being connected to the Touch Bar, it is in its own little well. Coders have been clamoring for the former, and we think that Apple did the latter to ease repair, if that sensor needs to be replaced.\\nIn our use, a physical escape key makes little difference \\x14 but for coders, it\\'s an entirely different story. We\\'ve been told about times where things have gone completely awry, and the virtual escape key on the Touch Bar doesn\\'t work at all, forcing a hard reboot.\\nAs a general rule, we like what the Touch Bar brings. After a lukewarm initial impression. we\\'ve adopted it into our workflows. We\\'re not going to say that everybody is going to like it, but utilities like Better Touch Tool open up a frontier of customization options, and we recommend it to anybody that has a Touch Bar and wants to use it beyond the Apple-sanctioned or developer-mandated uses.Testing the silicon\\nApple did include the same CPU options as the mid-2019 predecessors but thanks to its new internals, it is able to get slightly better performance out of the chips. When we compared the 16-inch base to the previous 15-inch base, we saw that single-core scores increased from 1061 to 1128 and multi-core scores increased from 5425 to 5641 on Geekbench 5.\\nIn Cinebench R20, scores jumped as well from 2395 to 2623. This is due to the machine being able to keep those cores cooler for longer.\\nRunning the Browserbench.org Speedometer test that measures web app performance on each machine, the new machine scored a 129 while the previous generation clocked in at a 126.8.GPU\\nFor the GPU, we turned once more to our usual Unigine Heaven benchmark. Running at full screen, with tesselation and stereo turned off, at medium quality (our standard settings), the new machine earned an average of 86.6 frames per second and a 2182 score. It maxed out at an impressive 162.1 frames per second.Unigine Heaven benchmark results for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\\nImpressively, that beats the VEGA 20 graphics from the previous design which earned a total score of 2072 and a max FPS of 147.4. It also won on average FPS over the previous 82.3. Again, that is our base model compared to the previous high-end selection.\\nIn another benchmark to test the performance of Metal, we ran the Geekbench 5 Compute test. The new base machine managed a 21757 while the previous base garnered only a 13919.\\nLastly, we performed an export test. Exporting the same 4K 24FPS Final Cut Pro X project from both base units with the same settings. Final Cut was updated The previous generation took 4 minutes and 15 seconds while the updated machine did the export in only 2 minutes and 38 seconds.Thermals\\nThe 2018 15-inch i9 MacBook Pro was a very hot machine. While it still holds up, Apple has improved the situation greatly with the 16-inch MacBook pro.\\nEight cores are hot. The 5500M chipset is toasty, and the RAM is too.\\nIn our use, when the 2018 i9 MacBook Pro was under load, the keyboard\\'s metal surface routinely hit 107 degrees Fahrenheit around the G, H, and J keys. That\\'s still usable, but it is very, very warm. On the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, that area is still the hotspot, but it hit a maximum of 89 degrees while running under load.\\nThere are still a large number of picky details to examine with the 16-inch MacBook Pro in regards to the thermal environment. We\\'ll be looking a lot more at varying work environments including ambient temperature effects, and machine orientations as the weeks and months wear on to see if they make any difference at all to performance.\\nBut, we\\'re not expecting to see much difference this time around.\\nIn regards to the revamped cooling system. Apple says that the 16-inch MacBook Pro has different fan blades and more surface area on all heat exchanging surfaces. This means that the computer sounds different under load.\\nStrictly from a noise standpoint, in the same 38 dBA room, the 2016 MacBook Pro under heavy load is about 45 dBa at the same range that we did the keyboard testing. The 16-inch MacBook Pro hit a maximum of 44 dBa, with equivalent fan speeds to the 2016 model.\\nThe MacBook Pro for the last seven years has sounded about the same. It\\'s hard to describe how it sounds now, but there\\'s a lower pitch and a different warble to the fans now, likely because of the new blade shape. You\\'ll notice the difference if you\\'re a long-time user, but it isn\\'t distracting, and you\\'ll forget the old sound pretty quickly.Using Final Cut Pro X on the new MacBook Pro\\nWe\\'ve only just started testing and thermal performance. Our initial testing suggests that the 16-inch MacBook Pro can maintain a higher clock speed for longer \\x14 which isn\\'t well-reflected in benchmark testing to date. The fans on the new MacBook Pro start to get audible in that 38 dBa office environment at about 83 degrees Celsius processor temperature. Based on observation, they start to pick up speed at about 75C \\x14 earlier than the 80C that the 2016 through 2019 MacBook Pro start to ramp up. We\\'ll be testing this more in the future.\\nThe efficacy of this thermal redesign in regards to your own workflow will vary very much depending on your individual workload. But, using a utility that turns off the boost feature on the processor essentially guarantees a silent machine with next to no fan noise, at a cost of taking about one and a half times longer to complete your job. We\\'ll be talking about this in the future too.Flash speeds are still blistering\\nThe drive is absolutely no slouch. Running the BlackMagic disk speed test after the machine had been indexing for two days, we saw a write speed of 2890 megabytes per second, and a read speed of 3150 megabytes per second on both a 512GB and 1TB model.\\nThis is a bit faster than the i9 MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019, and about 350MB per second faster than the 2018 MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage or more.Battery lifeBattery is improved on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\\nThis time Apple baked in a new 100Wh battery that is necessary for the beefed-up internals. That new battery doesn\\'t just match the last model\\'s performance, it extends it. While we didn\\'t have too much of a chance to surf the web for 11 hours on end, Apple says that is what you can expect \\x14 which is one hour more than the 15-inch offered.Speakers\\nWe didn\\'t expect much change when it came to speakers, but after trying them out we were wowed.\\nMoving between listening to our above test playlist reserved for speakers and headphones as well as Apple TV+ content with Dolby Atmos, it makes listening to content on a portable machine far more enjoyable.There are six speakers in the new MacBook Pro\\nBass was substantial, but thanks to the dual force-canceling drivers, it doesn\\'t cause the machine to shake or feel uncomfortable at loud volumes.\\nThe biggest note was how much larger and fuller the soundstage appeared as we listening to content from one machine to the other.Wi-Fi 6\\nOddly, Apple has a few omissions with the pro machine. The FaceTime camera is still capped at a meager 720p. But more frustrating, Apple has felt the need to hold back with 801.11ac Wi-Fi rather than jump to Wi-Fi 6 ax as we saw with the most recent iPhone launch.\\nConsidering a Mac is intended to be a portable machine, the lack of the latest Wi-Fi tech is frustrating. Users rightly expect to pick up a Mac and use it for several years and investing in a new machine shouldn\\'t be capped by previous standards. Especially one Apple has already adopted en masse with millions of iPhones.\\nWi-Fi 6 is still launching and there is only a smattering of ax routers on the market so looking at today\\'s landscape users aren\\'t missing out, but they will when they have this machine in two-three years and Wi-Fi 6 has been more widely adopted.\\nThere will certainly be some iPhone 11 Pro users who will jump on board with Wi-Fi 6 early to take advantage of it on their phones that will be left behind with the new MacBook Pro in that regard.Still four Thunderbolt 3\\nApple has now redesigned the MacBook Pro, listening to pro users, and the HDMI port has not returned. Thunderbolt 3 is staying. It\\'s past time to come to terms and deal with it.Still four Thunderbolt 3 ports\\nThe USB-C physical connector on Thunderbolt 3 is not the end of the world, but it is an adjustment for users, if you\\'re coming from a 2015 or older MacBook Pro. Complaints that there are multiple flavors of USB-C are correct, but this is more of an issue with cable labeling than anything else. That adjustment is better made, than tolerated using half-baked solutions. We\\'ve said this before, many times: there is no special hardware required to connect a HDMI or DVI monitor. Given that the Thunderbolt 3 protocol explicitly contains the HDMI protocol, a cable will do, or a dongle if you prefer. There is no breakout box needed for USB-A connectors, and a peripheral cable or dongle there can be had too, depending on what you need.\\nFortunately, since you have Thunderbolt 3, and not the other varieties of USB-C, cables are cheap, and plentiful. You can get there from here, and it isn\\'t expensive to do so.16-inch MacBook Pro\\nLike we\\'ve been saying for nearly four years now, if you\\'re hell-bent on sticking with your existing cabling instead of adopting cables with a USB-C end is choosing from one of many a Thunderbolt dock. Thunderbolt 3 docks start at $199 retail, and USB 3.2 type C ones can be had for cheaper than that, if you don\\'t need the full 40 gigabits per second that the faster protocol allows. \\nIn our testing, with a two-hour load on the MacBook Pro using both the CPU and GPU, an 87W Thunderbolt 3 dock or power adapter still drained the battery to the tune of about 4% per hour. Under \"normal\" office use or similar work there was no drain at all. If you have an older Thunderbolt dock from your 2012 or later Retina MacBook Pro, the $49 Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter will connect that unit to the new machine. It won\\'t supply power, but, fortunately, the 96W adapter that your machine came with will.\\nFurthermore, if you\\'re considering an external GPU, many of the enclosures have USB-A and Ethernet ports, in an accessory that costs not much more than a dock does. If all you need are a few USB-A ports, get a USB 3.0 dock, along with a USB-C to USB-B cable for around $8. Problem solved. Nothing that we\\'ve seen presently for eGPU enclosures provides 96W, but that will likely be rectified very soon.\\nRegarding MagSafe, we\\'ve been testing USB-C for a very, very long time at this point, and our results are unchanged. On a melamine, Corian, or finished wood desk surface, the force required to pull out Apple\\'s USB-C charging cable is about three-quarters of what it takes to break a MagSafe 2 connection, when the cable is pulled from less than a 40-degree angle from center on the horizontal plane, and less than 30 degrees from center on the vertical. The 96W USB-C power adapter\\nAnd, the AC adapter also has a USB-C connector with the same disconnect force, so now there are two rapid breakpoints in the case of an accident or inadvertent pull. Apple\\'s service numbers that we\\'ve collated bear out that the removal of official MagSafe hasn\\'t caused any notable increase in incidents. MagSafe\\'s introduction in January 2006 halved accidental damage service calls by 2009. There was no change in those numbers for MagSafe 2. But, in the three years since the MacBook Pro was released, there has been no increase in the accidental damage rate from a reported cable snag at all.\\nWith a 11-hour battery, we\\'re not sure why you\\'d want to string a power cord along a transit route anyway. If you\\'re that concerned about it, buy a USB-PD battery and keep it next to your computer.\\nIf you\\'re still not happy that MagSafe is gone, there are inexpensive options on Amazon.The MacBook Pro is a workhorse, but is not a desktop\\nThe MacBook Pro is not going to be the same maximum speed as the Mac Pro. It isn\\'t even going to top the iMac Pro in every regard. But, it is portable, and it is very, very fast. If you\\'re doing long runs of rendering or the like, the iMac Pro will work better for you. Despite some social media posts to the contrary, the iMac Pro is in no way a portable machine. While the new Mac Pro doesn\\'t have those seemingly sharpened handles that the old-school Mac Pro did, it isn\\'t really portable either, even if you spring for the wheels.\\nAs the last two i9 MacBook Pro were, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a solid machine, one that is faster than literally every other MacBook Pro ever made, if not by a lot.\\nNo matter how much of a Pro you are, not everything is a long processing job, constantly slamming the processor. Even most editing tasks aren\\'t constantly pushing your CPU and GPU to the absolute limits. As we\\'ve said time and time again, considering your own workflow in regards to what you do most of the time is crucial in making this decision.Editing in the Final Cut Pro X on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\\nIf you\\'re coming from a 2018 or earlier MacBook Pro, including the i9 2018 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with either flavor of i9 processor is unquestionably a great choice. However, the real-world performance for nearly every task that you will do, minus those blue-moon processor-crushing ones, the i9 performance isn\\'t supremely higher than that of the i7 \"baseline\" model.\\nAs with every other i9 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a lot of computer, with a lot of power, for a lot of money. There are cheaper machines with the i9, dealing with many of the same thermal constraints, running Windows. How much is macOS worth to you? You can say all you want that there are cheaper Windows options, and you\\'ll be right. But, none of them bring macOS to the table. As it was before, and as it remains, a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an i9 processor is the right tool for macOS jobs that demand portability. It is not the ultimate solution to every macOS-centric computing problem, and those people that need that solution probably already know that they need to wait for the Mac Pro tower.Score 4.5 out of 5Save hundreds on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\\nApple resellers are accepting orders for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro with a variety of incentives. Expercom is knocking up to $438 off select new configurations with coupon code appleinsider, while Adorama is taking up to $250 off retail models with promo code APINSIDER (prices start at just $2,199 with code).

        "articleBody": "b'\\nThe Jupiter moon Europa\\'s elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed seem to be real.NASA\\'s Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such plumes emanating from Europa, which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath its ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume\\'s water vapor directly for the first time, a new study reports.\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system. But the third \\x14 liquid water \\x14 is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary scientist at NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we\\'ve found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.Related: Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in ImagesPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as one of the solar system\\'s best bets to host alien life.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe researchers observed Europa for 17 nights, from February 2016 through May 2017. On one of those nights \\x14\\xef\\xbf\\xbdApril 26, 2016 \\x14 they got a strong signal of water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared light.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAnd there was quite a bit of the stuff \\x14\\xef\\xbf\\xbdabout 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons), according to the researchers\\' calculations. That\\'s almost enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric tons, of water).The researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be coming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa\\'s shell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted to result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules from Europa\\'s surface by Jupiter\\'s powerful radiation belts. And such stripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be noted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in the new paper, which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature Astronomy.Multiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For example, in addition to the new results and Hubble\\'s detection of atomic hydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by radiation), NASA\\'s Galileo Jupiter probe measured a big increase in the density of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.And it\\'s becoming increasingly clear that Europa\\'s plumes are sporadic. In that regard, they\\'re very different from the constant plume wafting from the south pole of Saturn\\'s icy, ocean-harboring moon Enceladus, which is generated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct detection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits of our detection method,\" Paganini said.Plumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to astrobiologists, because they\\'re sending \"free samples\" from potentially habitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic probes. And there\\'s a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just that, if everything works out just right.NASA is developing a mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close on dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for spots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future. Clipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys, if mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years \\x14\\xef\\xbf\\xbd or if they just get really lucky.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMike Wall\\'s book about the search for alien life, \"Out There\" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), is out now.

        "articleBody": "b'            Below, we analyze the snap counts and stats on defense for the Cleveland Browns\\x19 Week 11 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\\n\\n    Pos Player Plays % Stats     Pos Player Plays % Stats     DL Larry Ogunjobi 63 85% 1 tackle (1 combined). 1 sack, 1 TFL, 2 QH.

DL Eli Ankou 13 18% 1 tackle (1 combined). 1 TFL.    \\n\\n\\nThere is a lot to sort through here. As a defense, the Browns had 11 hits on Mason Rudolph (well, 12 if you count the helmet hit). 8 of those hits came from the defensive line. 5 of those hits were from two players facing suspension now (2 for Larry Ogunjobi, 3 for Myles Garrett).\\n\\nOgunjobi and Garrett have been playing a ton of snaps all season. Since Olivier Vernon\\x19s injury a couple of weeks ago, Chad Thomas has filled in and played way above my expectations (including logging another sack this week and almost having an interception). The problem is that Cleveland really doesn\\x19t have a long-term option to replace those snaps in the starting lineup.\\nIdeally, Vernon would come back from his knee injury this week, but when he\\x19ll return is still a question mark. Is veteran Chris Smith going to get most of Garrett\\x19s snaps (actually, Thomas would shift over)? Smith is good for depth, but as a starter, that\\x19s a hefty downgrade. The same goes for Ogunjobi up front. Sheldon Richardson is the only starter in tact right now; I\\x19d expect some works for this week\\x19s game in Miami.\\n\\n\\n    Pos Player Plays % Stats     Pos Player Plays % Stats     LB Joe Schobert 74 100% 7 tackles, 3 assists (10 combined). 1 sack, 2 TFL, 2 QH, 2 INT, 4 passes defended.

CB Tavierre Thomas 1 1% No stats registered.    \\n\\nHe may not have been flagged a lot, so the stat sheet won\\x19t show it, but this was a pretty rough game for Greedy Williams. The Steelers had no offensive players (with experience) left, so they wisely took the approach of chucking the ball down the sideline and hoping for a catch or interference. Williams was flagged once for it, but was borderline on a few other plays, and against better receivers, would have allowed the big catches. He needs to get his head snapped around more on those plays to locate the ball. On the bright side, his run defense has been great.\\n\\n\\n#Browns Greedy Williams has been solid in run support and tackling so far this season. He averages one miss for every 22 tackle attempts (T-15th) and is top-20 in both run defense (75.5) and tackling grade (77.4) among 127 qualifying CBs pic.twitter.com/I8NWz4blQC\\x14 PFF CLE Browns (@PFF_Browns) November 16, 2019\\n \\n\\nDenzel Ward is still waiting for his first interception of the year.

Safety depth has been shaky all season due to injury, and whatever that Jermaine Whitehead experiment was.\\n\\nJuston Burris and Sheldrick Redwine both stepped up to the plate and did a good job. But that was against Mason Rudolph, a below average quarterback. Fortunately, Randall will be back, and Burnett was never viewed as a long-term answer at strong safety.

        "articleBody": "b'When President Trump\\x19s advisers suggested that Beijing resume buying around $20 billion in American farm products as part of a trade deal, Mr. Trump wasn\\x19t satisfied. In a dramatic public retelling in the Cabinet Room, he said he pressed his team to more than triple that figure, then trimmed that a little and asked for up to $50 billion in annual purchases. \\x1cMy people had $20 billion done,\\x1d Mr. Trump recounted in an Oct. 21 cabinet meeting. \\x1cAnd I said, \\x18I want more.\\x19 They said, \\x18The farmers can\\x19t handle it.\\x19 I said, \\x18Tell them to buy larger tractors. It\\x19s very simple.\\x19\\x1d The cabinet members gathered around Mr. Trump laughed. Mr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks with China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has alternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of the insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even bigger threats should China not accede to his terms. But more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history, Mr. Trump\\x19s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for. Instead, the president\\x19s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even harder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic uncertainty across the globe. Despite Mr. Trump\\x19s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had reached a \\x1chistoric\\x1d Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has proved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate and could finalize an agreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators decide to compromise. But Mr. Trump continues to give mixed signals about whether he actually wants a deal and if any of his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be removed.\\x1cWe\\x19re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,\\x1d Mr. Trump said on Nov. 8. \\x1cI like our situation very much. They want to make a deal much more than I do, but we could have a deal.\\x1dA prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows him to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic criticism that he is caving to Beijing.But businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has prolonged financial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers, paralyzing firms that rely on robust trade flows between the world\\x19s two largest economies.Executives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some hiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by unforeseen policies, and conserve cash. The uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly manufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while Germany has barely avoided falling into recession. \\x1cIt\\x19s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions are threatening to put the brakes on growth,\\x1d John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. \\x1cThe uncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on the economic conditions we\\x19re experiencing today.\\x1dMr. Trump\\x19s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected similar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he might leave some trading partners behind.The president says his approach has created leverage \\x14 and in some cases, he is right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from Mexico, Canada, Japan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not otherwise have agreed to. It has also brought China, which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, to the negotiating table. But that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a close. Mr. Trump\\x19s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China wary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people familiar with Chinese trade policy said.Eswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president\\x19s \\x1cmercurial temperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating team\\x1d had complicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. \\x1cBy hyping up expectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes the prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and volatile,\\x1d he said.The two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of domestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take place in United States \\x1cfarm country,\\x1d but the Chinese have been reluctant to commit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized. Without a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure to get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the president\\x19s unpredictable behavior \\x14 as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-profile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea\\x19s leader, Kim Jong-un. They fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they anticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people familiar with their thinking. Mr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the only president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and that the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China has long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trump\\x19s efforts to remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged American firms operating in China.But they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated tensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack of resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the administration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and leaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its industry, for later talks. The roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on certainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of products that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China trade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the Trump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of goods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect \\x14 or whether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would remain.\\x1cIt makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,\\x1d said Phil Levy, the chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for companies. \\x1cIt really doesn\\x19t fit well with the world of global supply chains. And we\\x19re talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that.\\x1dEven Mr. Trump\\x19s supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration with his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the president doesn\\x19t want the show to end.In a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau, said farmers faced \\x1cnear-unprecedented economic uncertainty and hardship\\x1d stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and other key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible, saying \\x1ctime is running out for many in agriculture.\\x1dBut Mr. Trump\\x19s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal, including securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month. American negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the massive purchases Mr. Trump requested \\x14 larger purchases \\x1cthan any time in our history, by far\\x1d \\x14 into the actual text of a trade agreement. While China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork, it has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it favors American products over other countries\\x19, as well as agreements that could result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through. Even if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy and genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the calculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could increase its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a year, without diverting trade from elsewhere. Mr. Trump\\x19s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his administration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies will be removed if a deal is reached. The president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval Office with Liu He, China\\x19s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an increase in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back any levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been under pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United States.\\x1cWithout rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not raising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive of implementing this deal on the Chinese part?\\x1d He Jianxiong, the former executive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a Nov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b\" Posted on Oktober 27, 2015 by Admin  Sebelum Islam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah zaman Khalifah Ali karena pemberontakan Mu\\x19awiyah di tahun 37 Hijriyah. 26 tahun setelah wafatnya Nabi. Islam sudah sempurna secara aqidah mau pun fiqih. Islam sudah sempurna sebelum Nabi Muhammad SAW wafat. Jadi baik Sunni dan Syiah yg sebagian besar sahabat Nabi itu aqidah dan ibadahnya sama: Islam.\\nZaman Sahabat itu zaman terbaik Islam. Karena Islam saat itu sudah sempurna dan amat murni. Masih banyak orang2 yg melihat langsung amal ibadah Nabi, ngobrol bersama Nabi, berjuang bersama Nabi. Sementara kita di akhir zaman ini belum tentu benar karena sudah diselubungi fitnah.\\nIslam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syi\\x19ah karena faktor politik. Karena kekuasaan. Pendukung Ali disebut Syiah Ali yg kemudian disebut Syiah saja. Pendukung Muawiyah dan yg netral disebut Sunni.\\nSetelah pecah itulah jalan sendiri2.\\nImam Ja\\x19far Ash Shadiq yg merupakan guru dari Imam Malik dan Imam Abu Ha\\xef\\xbf\\xbdifah membentuk Mazhab Ja\\x19fari. Imam Malik yg merupakan guru dari Imam Syafi\\x19ie membentuk mazhab Maliki. Imam Abu Hanifah membentuk mazhab Hanafi. Imam Syafi\\x19ie guru dari Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Syafi\\x19ie. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Hanbali. Mereka semua punya hubungan guru dan murid.\\nDari sini juga perawi hadits Sunni dan Syiah jalan sendiri2. Imam Kulayni bikin kitab hadits Al Kafi. Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim dsb bikin kitab Shahih Bukhari, Shahih Muslim dsb. Sebagian perawi haditsnya dari Syiah bahkan di Rijalul Hadits ada yg disebut Rafidhi karena tak membolehkan orang bernama Mu\\x19awiyah masuk ke rumahnya.\\nAda juga percampuran Ilmu misalnya orang Syiah belajar dari ulama Sunni dan orang Sunni belajar dari ulama Syiah. Contoh kitab Subulus Salam yg biasa diajarkan di pesantren2 NU ternyata disusun oleh ulama Syiah.\\nCuma sekali lagi zaman Nabi Islam sudah sempurna. Jadi saat para sahabat pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah, Islam mereka sudah sempurna meski saat itu mazhab fiqih dan kitab2 hadits belum ditulis.\\nJadi keliru karena Syiah beda dgn Sunni langsung dibilang bukan Islam. Pelajari dulu sejarah Islam dari berbagai sumber. Bukan dgn 1 mata.``\\nPenghinaan terhadap Istri dan Sahabat Nabi\\nSebelumnya kita tegaskan bahwa menghina istri Nabi Siti \\x18Aisyah ra dan menghina Khulafaur Rosyidiin seperti Abu Bakar ra, Umar bin Khoththob ra, Usman bin Affan ra, dan Ali bin Abi Talib ra adalah perbuatan yang sesat. Harusnya dapat sanksi hukum misalnya 10 tahun penjara atau lebih berat lagi.\\nSyi\\x19ah Rafidhoh yang gemar menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi seperti Yasir Habib dan Tawhidi ternyata dipelihara Zionis Yahudi untuk memecah-belah Islam. Video Yasir Habib saat syahadah sering disebar ole Wahabi. Untuk menimbulkan kemarahan dan perang sesama Islam tentunya. Yasir Habib ternyata dipelihara London dan diberi dana untuk bikin Fadak TV. Tawhidi yang sekarang diundang ke Indonesia oleh Emilia Renita dari Oase dipelihara oleh Australia. Gunanya untuk membuat Indonesia kacau.\\nBukan cuma istri dan sahabat Nabi yang dihina oleh Rafidhi macam Yasir Habib. Bahkan Imam tertinggi Syi\\x19ah pun seperti Ali Khamenei mereka hina karena mengharamkan penghinaan tsb.\\nAhmadinejad: Siapa Menghina Sahabat Rasulullah Sekutu Musuh Islam\\nPresiden Ahmadinejad menandaskan, \\x1cDari tribun ini saya tegaskan bahwa barang siapa di mana pun ia berada menghina sahabat Rasulullah saw, maka ia bukanlah seorang muslim dan tidak bergerak di atas jalan Islam. Ia tidak lebih hanyalah kaki tangan dan alat mainan musuh-musuh asing.\\x1d\\nhttp://www.ipabionline.com/2013/02/ahmadinejad-siapa-menghina-sahabat.html#ixzz2PpyAj3AN\\nKhamenei: Haram Menghina Istri Nabi dan Simbol\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAhlusunah\\nhttp://syiahali.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/fatwa-para-ulama-larangan-mencaci-para-sahabat/\\nFatwa Para Ulama Syi\\x19ah Larangan Mencaci Para Sahabat\\nhttp://www.shia-explained.com/my/archives/2364\\nSekarang kita lihat asal muasal penghinaan terhadap istri dan sahabat Nabi.\\nSaya dulu merasa kehidupan semua sahabat rukun dan damai. Itu benar di zaman Nabi. Saat Nabi wafat, timbul perdebatan siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin ummat Islam sebagai Nabi. Kaum Syi\\x19ah umumnya berpendapat Ali berhak menjadi Khalifah. Sementara mayoritas sahabat mengangkat Abu Bakar ra sebagai Khalifah. Suka tidak suka, semua sahabat membai\\x19at Abu Bakar sebagai Khalifah. Termasuk Ali.\\nSaat Ali jadi khalifah, Siti \\x18Aisyah memberontak dalam perang yang disebut Perang Jamal yang menewaskan 17.000 orang. Saat Mu\\x19awiyah berontak dalam perang Siffin pun ada 70.000 Muslim yang tewas. Dari pihak Ali 25.000 orang yang tewas. Dari pihak Mu\\x19awiyah, 45.000 orang yang tewas.\\nNah kalau para sahabat ini saling bunuh dalam Perang Jamal dan Perang Siffin, tentu diawali dengan perang lisan dan juga tulisan. Saling hina. Bisa jadi tulisan2 yang mengina sampai ke kita hingga sekarang. Ini mirip saat Pilpres 2014 antara Jokowi melawan Prabowo di mana masing2 pengikut menghina yang lain. Bahkan Jokowi difitnah sebagai kafir sehingga keluarlah foto2 Jokowi sedang sholat.\\nItulah asal muasal penghinaan istri dan sahabat Nabi. Itu satu lembaran hitam sejarah yang harusnya kita tutup. Menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi yg dilakukan sebagian kaum Syi\\x19ah dan menghina orang tua Nabi yg dilakukan Wahabi itu dosa besar. Cuma kalau taubat dan pemimpinnya mengharamkannya, ya selesai. Allah Maha Pengampun.\\nManusia itu sifatnya salah dan lupa. Sebaik2 orang salah adalah orang yang taubat. Nabi Adam dan Nabi Yunus pun pernah salah, tapi begitu tobat, diampuni oleh Allah. Begitu. Makanya KH Quraish Shihab saat menilai Syi\\x19ah itu sesat atau lurus, beliau juga melihat perkembangan mereka. Yang tobat dan mengharamkan penghinaan thd sahabat ya otomatis tidak sesat. Sebaliknya yang tetap menghina, ini sesat.\\nPenghinaan pun macam-macam tingkatnya. Dari sekedar kritik yang santun, hingga penghinaan yang amat amat keji. Kitabnya pun ada. Sahabat yang dihina pun macam-macam. Dari sahabat Abu Bakar ra dan Umar bin Khoththob yang namanya dijamin Nabi masuk surga, hingga Mu\\x19awiyah yang masuk Islam setelah Futuh Mekkah da anaknya Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, Sayyidina Husein ra.\\nMenghina Siti Aisyah ra, Abu Bakar ra, dan Umar bin Khoththob ra tidak dibenarkan apa pun alasannya. Sesat. Sebaliknya menyatakan bahwa Mu\\x19awiyah berontak terhadap Khalifah Ali atau Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, itu sekedar kritik berdasarkan fakta sejarah. Namun kaum Sunni tetap menjaga lisan mereka untuk tidak mengutuk atau menghina Mu\\x19awiyah dan Yazid. Urusan mereka ada di tangan Allah.  Filed under: Syi'ah |  \\n\""

Unlike the original two films in the modern iteration of the franchise, Star Trek Beyond was directed by Justin Lin; 2009\\x19s Star Trek and 2013\\x19s Star Trek Into Darkness were directed by J.J.

Abrams was a producer on Star Trek Beyond, and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth film. \\nThis will be Hawley\\x19s second film\\nThe fourth Star Trek film was greenlit in 2016, with reports that Chris Hemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George Kirk, the father of Chris Pine\\x19s Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years is a long time, and actors\\x19 schedules shift. It\\x19s unclear whether Hawley\\x19s film is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return \\x14 both Hemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Wrap\\x19s report today claims that Pine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesn\\x19t mention Hemsworth.\\nThere are three scripts still in contention for the fourth Trek film, according to The Wrap, so it\\x19s possible Paramount is still deciding on a direction. As if things weren\\x19t murky enough, Deadline reports that Paramount is also still working on a second, R-rated Star Trek spin-off from Quentin Tarantino, which has been rumored since 2017. \\nThe fourth Star Trek movie will be Hawley\\x19s second film. Lucy in the Sky, his debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing with life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics \\x14 and flopped at the box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\\nNo release date for the fourth Star Trek film has yet been announced. \\n\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'   By Stefan Becket, Kathryn Watson, Grace Segers   November 20, 2019 / 1:07 AM / CBS News  Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council official, testified side-by-side before the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday about the events at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Volker said he had no knowledge of any efforts to urge Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\\nMorrison was the third witness testifying Tuesday who listened in on President Trump\\'s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he wasn\\'t concerned about the content of the call, but he did worry there would be \"political consequences\" if more people had access to the call summary.Republicans also questioned Morrison about his closed-door testimony, in which he raised questions about the judgment of another witness, Alexander Vindman, who is the White House National Security Council Ukraine expert. After Fiona Hill left the NSC, it was Morrison who took over, and Vindman reported to him.\\nHere are some of the highlights:\"My fears have been realized\" Day 3, Part 10: Tim Morrison\\'s opening statement Morrison told the Intelligence Committee, \"I feared at the time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington\\'s political climate. My fears have been realized.\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHe begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the illegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day that the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\" mutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.2. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden Volker: Allegations against Biden are \"not credible\" \"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening statement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25, 2019.\"Volker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate Ukrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he heard the July 25 call.\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into Burisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how Ukrainian officials could be confused.3. \"Not some irregular channel\" Volker insists he worked through \"official\" Ukraine channel, \"cringes\" at \"three amigos\" references Volker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what\\'s been portrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were known as the \"Three Amigos.\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbdVolker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe when I hear it.\"4. Questioning Vindman\\'s judgment Morrison discusses concerns about Vindman\\'s judgment Republican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC about Alexander Vindman\\'s judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his predecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison\\'s lawyer said the question was outside the scope of his testimony.Morrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had raised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect Vindman denied earlier in the day.Morrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about concerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal counsel.\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that\\'s something I would\\'ve expected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman\\'s superior, said. In his testimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National Security Adviser John Bolton \\x14 Morrison\\'s supervisor \\x14 to go straight to the NSC legal counsel with his concerns.Morrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion from some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\\n5. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging Volker says there was nothing unusual about hold on aid \"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the delay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"Volker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of August, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said. \"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that same time.\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbd6. \"The Gordon problem\" Tim Morrison on \"the Gordon problem\" Morrison testified that he didn\\'t always follow through on suggestions from Sondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland\\'s role in forming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"7. \"The Giuliani problem\"Volker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump\\'s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the new Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call made him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.\"So it\\'s fair to say you have not fixed the \\'Giuliani problem\\'?\" Schiff asked.\"That\\'s correct,\" Volker said.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n'"

In a new case study out Monday, they detail how the man came down with a rare form of allergy to the bird feathers that filled his new duvet and pillows.According to the study, published in BMJ Case Reports, the 43-year-old man had suffered months of dizziness, fatigue, and breathlessness by the time he visited his local doctor in November 2016.At first, his doctor assumed he had a lower respiratory tract infection, like bronchitis, and his symptoms did improve soon after. But by December, they worsened, to the point where he could no longer walk to the next room in his house without feeling out of breath. His doctor referred him to an urgent respiratory care clinic and sought out advice from one of the study authors, Owen Dempsey, a chest doctor at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\\x1cTheir immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion\\x14think Donald Trump rather than Barack Obama\\x1dDempsey talked with the man over the phone, trying to zero in any potential causes for his symptoms. And once the man mentioned that he and his wife had recently switched from synthetic bedding to a feather duvet and feather pillows, Dempsey quickly came up with a preliminary diagnosis that was later confirmed by lab testing: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or HP.The man had a particular form of HP that tends to strike people who raise or work closely with birds, which has earned it the nickname of \\x1cbird fancier\\x19s lung.\\x1d But in cases where people have gotten HP simply from being exposed to feather bedding, it\\x19s instead been dubbed \\x1cfeather duvet lung.\\x1d\\x1cIn some individuals that meet proteins from bird droppings or dust from their feathers, their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion\\x14think Donald Trump rather than Barack Obama,\\x1d Dempsey told Gizmodo by email.In recent months, hundreds of people in the U.S. have become acutely sick and have even died due to Read moreHP, as Gizmodo very recently explained, is a complex and rare condition. It involves different antibodies than the ones that cause a typical food or skin allergy. That means it isn\\x19t detectable through a standard allergy test, nor do people react instantaneously when they\\x19re exposed to their trigger. It\\x19s also not clear why any one person develops HP, since many of us can carry these specific antibodies to a trigger but never become sick.\\x1cMost people of course don\\x19t get this, and it depends on how their immune system is primed and is affected by their genetics,\\x1d Dempsey said.Because Dempsey quickly suspected feather duvet lung, though, he told the man to remove the bedding from his home the very first time they spoke. And within days, he began to improve. Subsequent treatment with steroids seemed to speed up his recovery, though Dempsey noted there\\x19s no definitive evidence that steroids will help with HP. Regardless, by the time he was weaned off treatment a year later, he was back to normal.\\x1cIt doesn\\x19t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\\x1d the man wrote in a patient perspective accompanying the case report.While it\\x19s likely that more people contract feather duvet lung than is documented, given how hard it is to diagnose, it\\x19s not something you should be worried about if you\\x19ve been sleeping contently under a down-filled duvet with no issues.\\x1cHold onto your feather bedding, but if you do get chest symptoms, e.g. breathlessness or cough, mention it to your health care professional,\\x1d Dempsey said. \\x1cMost don\\x19t think about it.\\x1d\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b' Indianapolis \\x13 Several thousand teachers wearing red surrounded the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday to call for better pay and more respect from the Republican-dominated state government in a protest that closed more than half of the state\\x19s school districts for the day. The union-organized rally represented Indiana\\x19s biggest such teacher protest amid a wave of educator activism across the country over the past two years.    Teachers chanted, \\x1cFund our schools,\\x1d and \\x1cPut kids first,\\x1d as hundreds of them lined entrances to the Statehouse, many holding handmade signs with sayings such as, \\x1cLess Money on Testing, More Money on Students.\\x1d Teachers with marching band instruments played \\x1cWe\\x19re Not Gonna Take It\\x1d from the Statehouse steps. High school math teacher Angela Cooper said she and more than 40 fellow teachers from the Gibson Southern schools near Evansville left about 4:30 a.m. for the rally. She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to leave for other jobs. \\x1cWe need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,\\x1d Cooper said. \\x1cThey start in the classroom but then they leave because they aren\\x19t paid enough.\\x1d Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand teachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct money from the state\\x19s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools. \\x1cThe crisis is now, and we need action now,\\x1d Gambill said to cheers from the crowd. \\x1cThe issue is funding, and the state has the money.\\x1d Nearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers unions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of their 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than 15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least 5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency didn\\x19t estimate how many total were on the grounds. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have avoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings. They seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers who used sick days to rally. However, they said they don\\x19t expect to take action on further boosting school funding until at least 2021. Other teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona. While some Indiana protesters chanted, \\x1cRed for Ed,\\x1d in a Statehouse hallway, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state budget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by 2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted the plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay. Bosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state\\x19s new ILEARN standardized exam taken last spring \\x13 one of the top concerns of the teachers unions. \\x1cWe get that you\\x19re frustrated,\\x1d Bosma said. \\x1cWe get that you are concerned about issues.\\x1d Teachers didn\\x19t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he was keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of the Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward Holcomb\\x19s 2016 election campaign. The governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in February to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020. Education advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was needed to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states. Republican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study showing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since 2002. McCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the state\\x19s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they weren\\x19t \\x1casking for the moon.\\x1d \\x1cWhat a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,\\x1d she said. Joel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana\\x19s Richmond High School, said politicians have \\x1cvilified\\x1d educators. \\x1cThey think they know better about education than us,\\x1d he said. \\x1cThey don\\x19t trust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when we\\x19re in the classroom.\\x1d \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'Rates of cannabis use disorder have risen in U.S. states where the drug has been legalized, including among children and teenagers, according to a study.The authors of the research published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry argued that while the policies have provided \"important social benefits, particularly around issues of equity in criminal justice,\" the climb in conditions like cannabis use disorder are \"a potential public health concern.\"To uncover the effects of the changes, researchers looked at surveys completed by 505,796 people between 2008 to 2016. Of the total participants who filled in The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in those years, just over half were female, 77 percent were aged 26 or above, 65 percent were white, 11.9 percent were black, 15.36 percent Hispanic, and 7.3 of another race or ethnicity.The team looked at data on states where cannabis had been legalized by 2016\\x14Colorado,Washington, Alaska, and Oregon\\x14 and noted if and how often respondents used marijuana in the past month, and whether they had cannabis use disorder before and after the laws were enacted.\\nCannabis use disorder is where a person\\'s use of the drug negatively affects their life over the course of 12 months. They might struggle to cut down, use so much it makes it hard to work or fulfil responsibilities in the home, and spend a lot of time taking the drug and recovering from its effects.In adults aged 26 or older, the number who said they had used cannabis in the past month rose by 23 percent when compared with states where recreational use isn\\'t allowed. Problematic cannabis use rose by 37 percent, from 0.90 percent to 1.23 percent, after recreational marijuana legalization.The number of respondents aged between 12 to 17-years-old who had cannabis use disorder rose \"slightly\" by 25 percent compared with those in the same group in other states, from 2.18 percent to 2.72 percent, the authors wrote.But among participants aged between 18 to 25-years-old, the rates of cannabis use in the past month, frequency and cannabis use disorder didn\\'t change.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nA stock image of a woman holding a joint. Researchers have looked at the relationship between legalisation and problematic use of the drug. \\nGetty\\n\\nMarijuana for recreational use has been legalized in 11 states and the District of Columbia. Using weed occasionally is not thought to cause substantial problems, the authors said. But long-term, heavy use is linked to physical and psychological problems, as well as lower educational attainment, decline in social class, unemployment, and motor vehicle crashes, they wrote.Senior author Dr. Silvia S. Martins, associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, commented: \"Cannabis use disorder in adolescence is associated with long-term adverse health, economic and social consequences.\\n\"Given our findings on problematic use across age groups, legalization efforts should coincide with prevention and treatment. The general public should be informed about both benefits and potential harms of marijuana products to make informed decisions,\" Martins said.Ian Hamilton, an expert in drug use and mental health at the Department of Health Sciences at the U.K.\\'s University of York who did not work on the study, told Newsweek: \"Although the researchers found that regular use increased by only a few percent following the policy change this could equate to a large proportion of the population given the popularity of cannabis. Even a small percentage increase in regular cannabis users can increase the risk of developing problems like cannabis dependence which services would be unlikely to have the capacity to support.\"This graphic, provided by Statista, shows the U.S. states where recreational marijuana has been legalized. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nU.S. states where marijuana has been legalized for recreational and/or medical use.\\nStatista\\n\\nHowever, he pointed out it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from observational studies such as this one. The researchers weren\\'t, for instance, able to collect any data about the strength or potency of the cannabis used, \"so it might be that some people were using low potency cannabis frequently which wouldn\\'t create the same degree of risk as those using high potency cannabis regularly,\" Hamilton argued.Hamilton urged people to be cautious of believing assertions made by suppliers and manufacturers related to cannabis, such as unevidenced claims about health benefits, and even basic information on strength.\"Although cannabis is less harmful than many other drugs it is not completely risk free, part of the problem is we are still unable to predict who is at risk of developing problems until they are exposed to the drug, by which time it is often too late,\" Hamilton said.But he said the results also don\\'t mean cannabis shouldn\\'t be legalized, rather \"that for the small proportion of users who develop problems support services need to be adequately funded and available, something other states and countries should factor in when thinking of changing their cannabis policies.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

The key to Stadia\\'s success, says Buser, is Google\\'s built-in infrastructure. \"We have one of the largest private networks in the world,\" he says, boasting that Google\\'s servers can \"deliver extremely high fidelity content all over the world.\" The goal is to deliver a \"seamless experience\" that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device they choose to play on.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was announced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed last week), featuring popular franchises such as Assassin\\'s Creed, Tomb Raider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny and more. Notably, only one title at launch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works\\' Gylt, while most of the other games offered have been on the market for months on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia throughout the end of the year and into 2020.\\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm IDC, sees Stadia\\'s lineup as its \"Achilles heel.\" While the monthly subscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60 frames per second and discounts on certain titles (Destiny 2 is available for free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for Stadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the games having been on the market for some time already.\\n\"They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\" says Ward. \"Google\\x19s planned \\'free\\' base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the hole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming community...and that should seed interest in the Founder\\x19s Edition bundle and Pro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games catalog will probably stay fairly thin and there\\x19s a lot of other gaming options out there.\"\\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both of which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google\\'s platform), Stadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \"Google offers an extension of the market of people who can play our games,\" says Chris Early, senior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \"They help extend our reach by letting people who maybe don\\x19t own a console or PC join in.\"\\n\"Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,\" Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, adds. \"Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader distribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We\\x19re excited by the opportunity and we\\x19ll see how it goes.\"\\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the industry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not the only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony Now service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project xCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with plans for its full launch set for next year.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nFor the nascent game streaming industry, \"2020 will be about getting these services in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\" Ward says. \"I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by several of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\"\\n\"Streaming is somewhat binary,\" says Early. \"You are either in a place with adequate bandwidth or you\\x19re not.\" In places like San Francisco and New York, bandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still says Ubisoft are \"believers\" in game streaming as a viable future for the industry.\\n\"The groundwork is there,\" Buser says. \"In terms of running games and having an experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist today. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will break the boundaries of what was previously possible. It\\'s just staggering.\"\\nWhile Stadia\\'s current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only three games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early says there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and launched specifically for the platform. \"Our objective is to make the best game and get it in front of as many people as possible,\" he says. \"I think the interesting question is if we\\x19re getting to a place that requires a game to be run in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not be that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a cloud base, whether that\\x19s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become something we\\'d look at.\"\\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also stepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade subscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was the list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple\\'s offering, all of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out each week.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\"I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches next year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\" says Ward.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the future of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early going. \"This is where you\\x19ll see the next big jump in what games can be,\" he says. \"You\\x19ll never download a game or have to download an update.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWe\\x19re already used to this in movies and TV, we just haven\\x19t seen it in games yet.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdIt\\x19s tough to go back to console.\"\\n\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'WASHINGTON (AP) \\x14 Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the most anticipated witness in the impeachment inquiry, is likely to be unpredictable when he faces questions about his evolving accounts of the Trump administration\\x19s dealings with Ukraine and a newly revealed summertime phone call with President Donald Trump.                              View all (23)  \\nSondland, a wealthy hotelier Trump tapped as his ambassador to the European Union, is more directly entangled than any witness yet in the Republican president\\x19s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and Democrats in the 2016 election. Yet Sondland has already amended his testimony once \\x14 \\x1cI now do recall,\\x1d he said, talking to Ukraine about investigations.Sondland\\x19s appearance at Wednesday morning\\x19s hearing, and his closeness to Trump, is of particular concern to the White House as the historic impeachment inquiry reaches closer to the president, pushing through an intense week with nine witnesses testifying over three days in back-to-back sessions.Trump has recently tried to suggest that he barely knows his hand-picked ambassador, but Sondland has said he has spoken several times with the president and was acting on his direction.The envoy is likely to face tough questions from lawmakers of both parties about Trump\\x19s July 25 call when he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the political investigations at the same time as U.S. military aid for the ally was being stalled.Sondland routinely bragged about his proximity to Trump and drew alarm from the foreign service and national security apparatus as part of an irregular channel of diplomacy led by the president\\x19s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.Last week State Department official David Holmes revealed one of those interactions to impeachment investigators, saying he recalled it \\x1cvividly.\\x1dThe political counselor was having lunch with Sondland in Kyiv when the ambassador dialed up the president on his cellphone and Holmes could hear Trump\\x19s voice.\\x1cI then heard President Trump ask, quote, \\x18So he\\x19s going to do the investigation?\\x19\\x1d Holmes testified. \\x1cAmbassador Sondland replied that \\x18He\\x19s going to do it,\\x19 adding that President Zelensky will, quote, \\x18do anything you ask him to.\\x19\\x1dSondland was known for telling others \"he was in charge of Ukraine\" despite being the U.S. envoy in Brussels, said another witness in the impeachment probe, former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill.\"And I asked, well, on whose authority?\\x1d said Hill, who will testify Thursday. \"And he said, the President.\"Sondland\\x19s appearance follows the testimony Tuesday of four national security and diplomatic officials, including a career Army officer who described Trump\\x19s call with Zelenskiy as \\x1cimproper.\\x1dLt. Col. Alexander Vindman told lawmakers it was his \\x1cduty\\x1d to report his concerns about the call, as he deflected Republican attacks, including from the White House on his loyalty and career in public service.It wasn\\x19t the first time Vindman had registered his concerns over Ukraine policy. He testified about a July 10 meeting at the White House when Sondland told visiting Ukraine officials they would need to \\x1cdeliver\\x1d before the administration would agree to a meeting Zelenskiy wanted with Trump.\\x1cAmbassador Sondland referred to investigations into the Bidens and Burisma in 2016,\\x1d Vindman testified, referring to the gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had a seat.At the White House, Trump said he had watched part of the day\\x19s testimony and slammed the ongoing impeachment hearings as a \\x1cdisgrace.\\x1d Over the weekend, Trump assailed Williams as part of the \\x1cNever Trumpers\\x1d who oppose his presidency, though there is no indication she has shown any partisanship.Former National Security Council official Timothy Morrison told investigators that he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Sondland and a top aide to Zelenskiy. Afterward, Sondland said he had relayed to the Ukrainian that U.S. aid might be freed if the country would announce the investigations, Morrison testified.Another diplomat, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, shifted his own account of the July 10 meeting to say Sondland did, in fact, discuss investigations with the visiting Ukrainians.\\x1cI think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,\\x1d Volker said.A series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and other leaders in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma.Volker said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had one in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani \\x1craised, and I rejected, the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.\\x1d___Associated Press writers Alan Fram, Zeke Miller, Laurie Kellman, Colleen Long, Eric Tucker, Lolita Baldor and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.       \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'The United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on Tuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal, while the Jewish state\\'s premier cheered on the \"historic\" move. The United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change the reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned the unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\" by the announcement. Pompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the establishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international law\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide. The decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the international community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring settlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land. Israeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did \"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\". The EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal. Netanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of Jerusalem on Tuesday. \"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the State of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement. The administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic injustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said. More than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, alongside more than three million Palestinians. Israel seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future Palestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War. Settlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump\\'s administration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel\\'s capital. Analysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off potential legal moves against Israel. The Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\". The Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the Trump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called for an emergency meeting of the body. The only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and Jordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\". Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of measures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate. \"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial investigation,\" he added. Key Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to varying degrees. Russia\\'s foreign ministry said it viewed Washington\\'s move as \"another measure contradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely further heighten tensions on the ground.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd The French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to encourage... settlement building\". A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK\\'s position that settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\". The US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context for a series of suits and complaints against Israel. The European Union\\'s top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify products made in Israeli settlements on their labels. The ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the coming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements. Israeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu\\'s right-wing constituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of West Bank settlements into Israel. \"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an international consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said Avi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel. Erekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the Palestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state. \"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally, externally, regionally - to put pressure on us. We stand tall and we will stand tall.\" This article has been adapted from its original source.\\n\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'      John M. Ford in 1987. Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by David Dyer-Bennet.      Three years ago, over breakfast, my friend Helen handed me a novel about a quest that, unknown to both of us, would set me off on a quest of my own. The book was called The Dragon Waiting, and it was written by the late science fiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market paperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical fervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford\\x19s obscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one of them.   The Dragon Waiting is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before George R.R. Martin wrote A Song of Ice and Fire, Ford created an alternate-history retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark magic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy. The Dragon Waiting provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of Gene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellect ensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with another.   I wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of this mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It\\x19s currently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not available at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into this level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford\\x19s career, the more frustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had won the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a beloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton, Ellen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and Daniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn\\x19t anyone publishing his books?   It would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to the vast treasure trove of Ford\\x19s uncollected and unpublished writing. It would introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn\\x19t spoken to each other since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John M. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed republication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen? More importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly than that: How did he write those amazing books?   John Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane Starner, \\x1cHe was brilliant from the start\\x14reading at an adult level when he was in kindergarten and talking to college students.\\x1d He played chess and loved model trains. But he was also sickly\\x14after nearly falling into a coma at the age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana University, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and amassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two years, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first novel, Web of Angels, a cyberpunk book before the term was invented. Pocket published it in 1980.*   After that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His body of work resembles some beast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs, guarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is made up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often than not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. \\x1cWhen you\\x19re reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,\\x1d said Beth Meacham, one of his editors at Tor. \\x1cEvery book contained a puzzle of some sort. And the play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple meanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.\\x1d   All his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will be utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital connections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading, and faith that the author knows what he\\x19s doing are essential for navigating these moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the novelist Jo Walton explained them to me. \\x1cYou\\x19re only seeing the tenth of the iceberg that\\x19s out of the water in every novel,\\x1d she said. \\x1cIt makes it dense in a really powerful way, but sometimes it\\x19s too hard for people because he wouldn\\x19t spell things out.\\x1d When his editors would ask him to explain himself more, he\\x19d respond, \\x1cI have a horror of being obvious.\\x1d   Ford also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people, and real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes, nor do they always understand what\\x19s going on, particularly if they lack power, as Ford\\x19s characters often do. If there\\x19s one unifying theme to his books, it\\x19s a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In The Dragon Waiting, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed with guilt after committing her first murder. The Last Hot Time, an urban fantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own desire to be a dom in bed. Growing Up Weightless, a story of political intrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their children.   \\x1cHad he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would\\x19ve been George R.R.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdMartin.\\x1d  \\x14 Neil Gaiman    But the novels were only the beginning. The errata of John M. Ford could fill volumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show called \\x1cAsk Dr. Mike\\x1d at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted out absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote handbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the maps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including The Eye of the World, the first book in Robert Jordan\\x19s Wheel of Time series. His blog comments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was a villanelle about King Edward IV.) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his Christmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or short satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every year during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called \\x1cWinter Solstice, Camelot Station,\\x1d went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it here.)   \\x1cHe would make art in the most surprising places,\\x1d Gaiman told me. \\x1cOnce he wrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy Fawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.\\x1d When Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he would scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them for her to find. \\x1cLife was not long enough,\\x1d she recalled, \\x1cfor Mike to do all the stuff that he would think of to do.\\x1d   \\x1cHe could have had a more successful career,\\x1d Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa\\x19s husband and Tor\\x19s editor in chief, said, \\x1cif he had been more disciplined about his writing\\x1d and stuck to one genre, or written a series. \\x1cBut Mike wanted to write what he wanted to write.\\x1d   No single example illustrates this better than The Dragon Waiting and its aftermath. As Gaiman put it, \\x1cHad he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would\\x19ve been George R.R. Martin.\\x1d Ford opted instead to write two Star Trek novels (The Final Reflection and How Much for Just the Planet?, both unexpected delights) and The Scholars of Night, a riff on midcentury British espionage thrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at its center. Gaiman still bemoans that The Scholars of Night \\x1cshould\\x19ve been marketed like The Name of the Rose. You needed to go, `We have a great writer who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines high and low culture.\\x19 \\x1d Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St. Martin\\x19s, published Scholars with a blank back cover. It didn\\x19t exactly do Umberto Eco\\x13level business.       Neil Gaiman and John M. Ford in 2002. Photo by David Dyer-Bennet    Even if Ford had found a larger audience, though, his health problems and lack of insurance would have kept his finances on the thinnest of ice. \\x1cAll it took was one bad infection and Mike would wipe out every penny he had,\\x1d Teresa Nielsen Hayden explained. \\x1cTo be an adult about money would mean to be permanently impoverished, give up on books, give up on travel, give up on the things that made his life so much better. And so he didn\\x19t.\\x1d   To the extent that Ford\\x19s health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare, a health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a kidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made possible by the doctor\\x19s willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent that his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends, particularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited The Scholars of Night, and her husband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired Ford to work as a \\x1cgames consultant\\x1d for the Wheel of Time series, mostly to help keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford as his \\x1cblood brother,\\x1d had essentially adopted him.   Ford needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family. The causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his mother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner says that Ford\\x19s biological family were conservative Christians; Ford\\x19s attitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote where God cheats at Scrabble. But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue was Ford\\x19s partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.   The two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had been married for two years when she and Mike began dating. \\x1cMy partner to whom I am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle initial M,\\x1d Matthesen recalled in an email. \\x1cI used to refer to them collectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.\\x1d   \\x1cThe thing with Elise bothered\\x1d Ford\\x19s family, Starner said. \\x1cI don\\x19t know whether they were completely estranged before that or not.\\x1d But either way, at some point, Ford\\x19s now-deceased father told Starner that \\x1cthe only way I know he\\x19s alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.\\x1d   In his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words long, titled Aspects. Beth Meacham described it as \\x1ca magical-parliamentary-nobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.\\x1d When he\\x19d finish chunks of it, he\\x19d fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton, and Meacham. They were all amazed by it.    Although Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he struggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard it was to weave action into some parts of the story. \\x1cIt\\x19s not exactly like I can have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,\\x1d he wrote. Then, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so delighted his friends:   If a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is a high fantasy.If he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.If he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorker story.   Two months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He was heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise Matthesen found him. \\x1cHe looked a little surprised,\\x1d she wrote in an email. \\x1cSort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.\\x1d Although he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was therefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had \\x1cmarried,\\x1d but in a self-scripted Klingon ceremony during a convention. (\\x1cThe Klingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,\\x1d was how Ford described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford\\x19s family, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford\\x19s passing. She would have one phone conversation with Ford\\x19s mother. After that, everything would be done through lawyers.   According to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006, Ford\\x19s unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his estate. But the document had been left in Ford\\x19s apartment, which she could no longer legally access. Matthesen and Ford\\x19s friends wanted some say in the disposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel were unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford\\x19s body, cleaned out his apartment, and, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own memorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford\\x19s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, someone tried to edit Ford\\x19s Wikipedia page to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.   By 2018, when I started digging into this story, only The Last Hot Time, the story collection Heat of Fusion, and the two Star Trek novels remained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his major works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAspects, had reverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford\\x19s family. No one had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal, and Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford\\x19s literary estate and set up a foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story, repeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, online) was that Ford\\x19s family did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of print. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them for comment on this article.   An agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement community in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late nephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the family. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece were suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford\\x19s sister, Martha Fry. \\x1cI cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print,\\x1d she said.   All contact between Ford\\x19s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbitterness.   Martha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they could do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of that interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or his parents, saying instead he was \\x1cintroverted by nature.\\x1d \\x1cI once visited Mike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,\\x1d Dale wrote. \\x1cWe went to an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. & Our parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We found some of the opened letters among his belongings.\\x1d Martha added that shortly before their father\\x19s death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the letter Mike wrote was \\x1ckind and loving.\\x1d   They also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike\\x19s relationship with Elise. \\x1cMike\\x19s personal life was his own business and did not affect our feelings for him as a family,\\x1d Dale wrote. \\x1cI am appreciative to [Elise] for finding Mike\\x19s body and calling the police. & Martha read a copy of the police report, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as \\x18friend,\\x19 not a legal spouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike found caring friends during his adult life.\\x1d   They refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple friends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote back, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that. Ford and Fry replied that I was threatening them with \\x1cthe unsubstantiated beliefs of uncited individuals & if we do not respond to your satisfaction on Mike\\x19s commercial affairs.\\x1d However, they volunteered that on three separate occasions they had written to Mike\\x19s agent, trying to see if there was any interest in reprinting his work. When they didn\\x19t hear back, they assumed there wasn\\x19t.   This seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford and wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal. Was it really possible, I asked Ford\\x19s friends, that his agent could have ignored his family\\x19s requests?   The answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford\\x19s agent had dropped out of the industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford\\x19s death, his agent Valerie Smith \\x1cwas beginning the process of essentially vanishing\\x1d from the industry. She \\x1cbecame more and more intermittent\\x1d with phone calls and correspondence, and many of her clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her in a decade.   After a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdSmith still found it difficult to talk about Mike Ford\\x19s death and the events surrounding it. She had represented him since 1978.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWeb of Angels\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwas the first novel she ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal battle unrelated to her literary work left her \\x1cpretty overwhelmed,\\x1d she said.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHer heartbreak over Mike Ford\\x19s death, an event that still leaves her angry today, helped push her further out of the industry. \\x1cWhen I started, I really felt like this was where I was meant to be,\\x1d she said. \\x1cI just can\\x19t bring myself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.\\x1d Smith said she never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike Ford\\x19s work.   And so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage, seeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths remained obscure. I do not share Ford\\x19s horror at obviousness, but there are simply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his family grew apart, or, from the family\\x19s perspective, how far apart they were. We will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out Elise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)   But I reconnected Ford\\x19s family and editors at Tor, and after a year of delicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have reached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into print, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other uncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me to Ford, The Dragon Waiting. Then, in 2021, Tor will publish\\x14at long last\\x14the unfinished Aspects, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.   As in one of John M. Ford\\x19s novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached. It\\x19s not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It\\x19s not one that ties up every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that happen. But the ending they\\x19ve carved out reaches some kind of resolution and leaves their world a bit better off than when they started.   When I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of Elise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford\\x19s work, still smarting from the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?   \\x1cI don\\x19t even have words, it\\x19s such good news,\\x1d she replied in an email. \\x1cExcept maybe Mike\\x19s words.\\x1d   In 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention. She put to him a prompt that had long been bouncing around in her head: I\\x19m going to die. Tell me a story.   \\x1cNo,\\x1d he said. \\x1cNo. You tell me one, and when you\\x19re gone, I\\x19ll tell it to somebody else.\\x1d   Correction, Nov. 15, 2019: This article originally misidentified the first publisher of John M. Ford\\x19s novel\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWeb of Angels. It was Pocket, not Tor.  \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'The merger of the big newspaper chains Gannett and GateHouse Media, which became final Tuesday, will create a \\x1cstronger\\x1d and \\x1cmore viable\\x1d print and digital news enterprise \\x1cwith deep local roots and national scale.\\x1dThat\\x19s the optimistic view mouthed by Michael Reed, the CEO of New Media Investment Group, GateHouse\\x19s parent, on Nov. 14 after the deal was approved by shareholders of both companies. One would hope so, since the news business could use an injection of optimism these days. Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the \\x1cnew Gannett,\\x1d as Reed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news organizations. Since 2008, there hasn\\x19t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole. News industry analyst Ken Doctor \\n\\nBut there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack. \\nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don\\x19t much care for.\\x1cSince 2008, there hasn\\x19t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,\\x1d says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That\\x19s produced a strategy of \\x1ccontinuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news.\\x1d The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time. The merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said that he expects to wring as much as $300 million in \\x1csynergies\\x1d from the combination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the workforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it \\x1cimmaterial\\x1d) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred. The private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources \\x14 with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole. (Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of Tribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake held by Tribune\\x19s former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9 million.)But public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can\\x19t escape the industry\\x19s economic challenges. Sacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry\\x19s coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company\\x19s news assets. But the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million. McClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn\\x19t have the cash or cash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its pension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by the government\\x19s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. McClatchy\\x19s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly demanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune\\x19s largest shareholder.\\nThat said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune\\x19s large-market publications would have balanced McClatchy\\x19s stable of smaller metro newspapers. \\nTribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having paid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong\\x19s purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major shareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.Indeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune. Both companies declined to comment on the assertion.The most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation in the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as Alden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any savings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that\\x19s where the news audience has been moving to.GateHouse hasn\\x19t been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm\\x19s practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to \\x1cconsolidate copy editing and page design\\x1d at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. \\x1cGateHouse-owned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,\\x1d Abernathy reported.Reed, who will be the merged company\\x19s chairman, told investors of New Media, the GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to quickly pay down debt and \\x1cto return capital to shareholders through dividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.\\x1d It shouldn\\x19t escape notice that it\\x19s not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with \\x1cinvesting for growth.\\x1d\\nThe increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as a major player in the company through an initial public offering and a bankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract. Fortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will leave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an investor conference call as \\x1cmorally wrong.\\x1d\\n\\x1cI know we\\x19re happy to get rid of Fortress,\\x1d Cooperman told Reed. \\x1cThey brought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they\\x19re going to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn\\x19t even take the money, given what they\\x19ve done here.\\x1d (Cooperman is the billionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her proposal for a wealth tax.)Plunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that remains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. \\x1cFinancial players like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,\\x1d says Doctor. \\x1cThey see the way down as close to inevitable.\\x1dIn the news business that\\x19s a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public companies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have imposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on physical delivery \\x14 McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all its newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles online. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other national-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.As traditional revenues continue to decline \\x14 and at an ever faster pace \\x14 those companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital news requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says, they\\x19re trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate destination remains unclear.\\x1cAfter two more years of this,\\x1d Doctor asks, \\x1cwhat kind of products are going to be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital subscription? What\\x19s your strategy after all the cost-cutting?\\x1d\\n'"

My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while I\\x19m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesn\\x19t want to spend it. He\\x19s older and has health concerns and mobility issues.Am I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than his love for me? Or should I be content and happy I\\x19m going to a beautiful country? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATEDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a beautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your penny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you than he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or he\\x19ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.DEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant we\\x19ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies\\x19 room and was washing my hands when a waitress I don\\x19t care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn\\x19t let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.My husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her \\x1csister\\x1d didn\\x19t answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.The restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn\\x19t care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I\\x19m 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didn\\x19t. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIADEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.DEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.A few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTERDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don\\x19t think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

        "articleBody": "b' While Anglophiles spent the weekend watching the third season of The Crown on Netflix, the real Prince Andrew was busy distancing himself from a more sinister style of royal drama.  In an interview about his friendship with billionaire pedophile and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, BBC\\x19s Emily Maitlis did an excellent job pressing Andrew. Maitlis repeatedly demanded how Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II\\'s third child, could be so sure what he was doing on the night of March 10, during which he allegedly raped 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Epstein\\x19s alleged sex trafficking ring.  Andrew doesn\\x19t remember any raping, but he definitely remembers going to get pizza that night. \"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do,\" he said. \"I remember it weirdly, distinctly.\"  Andrew also spent 45 seconds explaining how he couldn\\x19t have been with Giuffre, because she described him as sweating, and at that point in time, he had a medical condition in which he couldn\\x19t sweat.  \\x1cOh, actually? Yes,\\x1d he assures himself. \\x1cI didn\\x19t sweat at the time.\\x1d  But, to cover his tracks in case the paparazzi catch him sweating, he explained that he can sweat now.  Andrew has no memory of the photograph of himself with Giuffre, either. And if there was any indication of Epstein\\x19s crimes during the years in which they were friends, visiting each other at their respective swanky homes, he simply can\\x19t remember.  \\x1cThere was no indication, absolutely no indication,\\x1d Andrew said. \\x1cAnd if there was, you have to remember that at the time, I was the patron of the [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children\\x19s] \\x18Full Stop\\x19 campaign, so I was close-up with what was going on in those \\x14 time about getting rid of abuse to children, so I knew what was, what the things were to look for but I never saw them.\\x1d  The fact that Andrew was sponsoring a campaign against child cruelty doesn\\x19t seem like a point in his favor. It seems more like a devastating irony.  As if all of this hedging wasn\\'t enough to strengthen suspicion that the accusations are true, Andrew said he doesn\\x19t regret his relationship with Epstein because of \"the opportunities I was given to learn\" about business. In other words, who cares if someone is a sex-trafficking pedophile if they can teach you a bit about profiting off the stock market?  The interview should be a nail in the coffin to Andrew\\x19s apparent guilt in associating with and enabling Epstein for so many years.  \"He knows exactly what he\\'s done,\" Giuffre said before the interview. \"And I hope he comes clean about it.\"  Andrew hasn\\x19t come clean about anything, but his flustered and incoherent denials speak volumes. Let\\x19s hope we see more of Epstein\\x19s associates \\x14 from politicians such as Bill Clinton and President Trump to media figures such as Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, and Chelsea Handler \\x14 grilled about their connections with him.  Unfortunately, Andrew\\x19s interview only appears to have happened thanks to his publicist quitting. After this, Epstein\\x19s powerful friends will be more careful, and no one else will be so foolish as to accidentally admit what appears to be guilt. \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'\\nIn October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\\nBorder agents \"say you\\x19ve got to pay attention to this \\x14 $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer, the Wheeling News-Register.\\nIs this number correct? It\\x19s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nWe\\x19ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nAs a result, in this fact-check, we\\x19ll interpret McKinley\\x19s comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley\\x19s office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\\nHere\\x19s the most recent data on drug seizures \\x14 cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl \\x14 from Customs and Border Protection.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriff\\x19s office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\\n\\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nThat\\x19s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it\\x19s in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It\\x19s unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\" McKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million.

Local auto dealers sold 30,154 new cars, trucks and SUVs in October, the second-highest sales volume of the year thus far but still down 10 percent from a year ago, according to the TexAuto Facts report from InfoNation, a Sugar Land-based provider of automobile data.  Consumers have purchased 208,560 new vehicles this year, down 5 percent from the year-to-date period last year. Truck and SUV sales are down 2.6 percent, while sedan sales are down 12.3 percent. Dealers last year sold 303,417 new vehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d InfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c2019 is just not as strong as 2018.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d      On HoustonChronicle.com: Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August  The sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan stayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage rate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2 percent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based automobile data firm.  Industry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten deals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year. The Federal Reserve\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder of the year.   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle purchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds\\' executive director of industry analysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or SUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower financing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"  On HoustonChronicle.com: Group 1 Auto makes inroads in online sales  Despite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing. The average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014, up from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.  The average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the average price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New infotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup cameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up, McDowell said.     Houston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments -- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle sales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month average of 15.2 percent.  Nationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an increase of just 0.3 percent from 2017. Edmunds expects 16.6 million vehicles will be sold this year.   paul.takahashi@chron.com twitter.com/paultakahashi   \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b' \\xef\\xbf\\xbd AmazonThe symptoms came on quickly. First it was hard to breathe, then dizzy spells caused by any amount of exertion.  \"Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out,\" wrote 43-year-old Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in a case study published Monday in the journal BMJ.\"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 minute activity, as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" Taylor added.Four doctor appointments failed to find the cause, which was \"extremely distressing,\" wrote Taylor, who had never smoked. With his health failing, he stayed home from work and spent most of his days and nights asleep.Taylor didn\\'t know at the time that he was suffering from hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease in which lungs become inflamed as the result of an allergic reaction. Caught early, the disease is easily treatable. Undiagnosed, it can lead to permanent lung scarring, and even death.Unfortunately, in Taylor\\'s case, the doctors he first saw had no clue as to the cause.Time for Dr. SherlockAt first Taylor was treated for an upper respiratory infection. But his health continued to decline over the next three months. Then a radiologist dismissed a chest X-ray of his lungs as normal.Concerned, his family doctor put in a call to the urgent respiratory clinic and spoke to Dr. Owen John Dempsey, a consultant chest physician at BMI Albyn Hospital in Aberdeen, Scotland, about a 30-minute drive from Aberdeenshire.\"His general practitioner was very astute in not accepting the chest X-ray result at face value,\" Dempsey said, adding that it can be difficult to diagnose hypersensitivity pneumonitis because the changes are often subtle with just a \"slight diffuse greyness to the lungs.\"\"I think the radiologist may have thought it was just a slightly \\'under-exposed\\' chest X-ray,\" Dempsey said. Dempsey picked up the phone and rang Taylor.\"He sounded very breathless, having just walked from one room in his house to the other,\" Dempsey said. \"Very abnormal for such a young man. It was clear the patient had progressive and really very disabling breathlessness, now interfering with activities of daily life.\"Making the diagnosis was \"a bit like a jigsaw,\" Dempsey said. One of the first clues was Taylor\\'s blood work, which showed his immune system was exposed to avian protein. However, Taylor told Dempsey he didn\\'t own any birds, just a cat and dog.\"I have a particular interest in this group of diseases,\" Dempsey said. \"And we know that if you take a meticulous history, you can often identify triggers in the environment for lung diseases.\"Dempsey dove deeper: Taylor lived in a warm, dry house with his wife. They had a loft, which he didn\\'t visit much, but they did have an en-suite bathroom with a bit of mold above the shower and window. He hadn\\'t traveled to a foreign area. He had no drug history. He worked in an office with no obvious exposures. And he played guitar and saxophone in a local band.\"We are paid to be nosy,\" Dempsey said. \"The danger is that we don\\'t ask enough and assume diseases are \\'idiopathic\\' or unexplained. If so, we miss a trick and our patients are subjected to unnecessary tests or treatments.\"Finally, Dempsey\\'s questions hit pay dirt: The couple had recently replaced their synthetic bedding with a feather duvet and feather pillows. Taylor had Feather Duvet Lung disease.As Sherlock would say, \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbdFeather Duvet Lung diseaseBird allergies are not uncommon. Often called bird fancier\\'s asthma, symptoms can range from a wheezy cough, runny nose and eye irritation to asthma to more serious complications such as Taylor\\'s. People with allergies are most at risk when bird cages or lofts are cleaned out, and during the time of year when birds molt and shed their feathers. Feather Duvet Lung disease is a subset of bird fancier\\'s asthma, and it\\'s difficult to diagnose because of its rarity and the wide variety in timing and type of symptoms. Onset of symptoms following exposure to new feather duvets or pillows can range from three weeks to five years. Difficulty in breathing can grow over time, and the patient can have night sweats, dry cough, weight loss and fever. The condition is often misdiagnosed if the person reports no birds in the home, and many doctors don\\'t think to ask about bedding.\"Most doctors, in my experience, don\\'t ask that level of detail,\" Dempsey said, adding that doctors should always ask about exposures at home, including bedding, molds, the warmth and dryness of the home, and any unusual hobbies or pastimes.Early recognition of avian antigen exposure and removal of the bedding or other irritant is critical to recovery for patients, Dempsey stressed.Successful treatmentWhile studies have not always supported the use of steroids, in this situation they were successful, especially since Taylor also removed the feather bedding.\"The steroids which were prescribed after diagnosis ... had a transformative effect within two days,\" Taylor wrote. \"The course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. \"I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn\\'t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland\\n \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b\"How can a duvet affect your lungs when it is too big to go up your nostrils? (Photo: Getty Images)GettyThe Corrs\\x19 song \\x1cBreathless\\x1d probably doesn\\x19t refer to a duvet. However, it was this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a serious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal BMJ Case Reports.Wondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and even eventually be life-threatening? Well, go on, go on. This case report may leave you breathless.For the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris RuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November 2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor initially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but contrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn\\x19t get better afterwards. In fact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the point where he couldn\\x19t walk from one room to another without getting out of breath.Here is how bad things got in the words of the patient: \\x1cTwo months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs to bed was a 30\\tmin activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep (day and night).\\x1dAt first glance, the man didn\\x19t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless. He wasn\\x19t a smoker. His workplace didn\\x19t expose him to anything unusual. His main hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated that he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils. Ah, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently \\x1cacquired\\x1d both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go on, go on.Breathing tests showed that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much air as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren\\x19t moving as well between his lungs and his blood vessels as they should.A CT of his chest showed a \\x1cground glass\\x1d pattern in both of his lungs. Some lymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were consistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but hypersensitivity pneumonitis. HP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your lungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to breathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird droppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers. When the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called \\x1cfeather duvet lung.\\x1d When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is \\x1cbird fancier\\x19s lung.\\x1d When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called \\x1cpigeon breeder\\x19s lung.\\x1d If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken costume, well that doesn\\x19t occur often enough to have its own name. Wait there\\x19s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what\\x19s called \\x1cfarmer's lung,\\x1d not to be confused with a farmer\\x19s tan. \\x1cHumidifier lung\\x1d may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some similar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is \\x1chot tub lung,\\x1d which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn\\x19t. The bacteria in hot tubs can travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it\\x19s not always good if what\\x19s in a hot tub makes you breathless. Not all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic reaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo: Getty Images)GettyThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm the reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the feather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling of mold. According to the man, the steroids \\x1chad a transformative effect within 2\\tdays. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the allergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.\\x1d Eventually everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, \\x1cthe course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%\\x1398%\\twhich I understand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn\\x19t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.\\x1dFortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the inflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can result. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible. Not surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life threatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live. So, if something is leaving you breathless and it\\x19s not someone you fancy, you may want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic reaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap or anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the many bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it\\x19s the pigeons that you are breeding in your kitchen. Before you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the flocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like \\x1cfeather duvet lung\\x1d are still relatively uncommon. That\\x19s why this case became a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may have seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where even the slightest touch and you feel weak. \\n\""

(AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 About a dozen black female small-business owners were gathered in a South Carolina shared workspace on Tuesday night for a networking event when they were told the newest 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, Deval Patrick, would be stopping by to introduce himself.  When Patrick walked into the back of the room mid-meeting, the women turned around as he sheepishly apologized for his tardiness and short stay.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told them.  But the black former Massachusetts governor is eager to get their attention \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and their vote.   Launching his bid for president less than three months before the Iowa caucuses, Patrick is betting that he can make his case to a broad coalition of voters, including many who remain undecided or uncommitted to anyone in the crowded field of candidates. To win South Carolina, which holds the first Southern primary of 2020, he would need a base of support from the black voters who comprise roughly two-thirds of the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Democratic electorate.      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running for president because those values of community, that we have a stake in each other and of generational responsibility, I think, are frayed in the country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Patrick said Tuesday night in Columbia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI come in humbly. ... I want to be a listener.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Arguing that voters are just now beginning to tune in, with the first votes less than 100 days away, Patrick has said he will have visibility when the populace is really paying attention. His late entry, though, makes it that much tougher to raise the awareness that his campaign will need to meet the polling and fundraising thresholds for future debates.   This week, Patrick launched a tour of early-voting states, visiting Nevada and Iowa before South Carolina. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a state where former Vice President Joe Biden has maintained a significant polling lead for months, both across all spectrums and with black voters specifically.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a place where the two other major black candidates in the race \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have struggled to gain momentum, despite months of campaign events.  Eyamba Sowers didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know Patrick was coming to Tuesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s networking gathering but saw his visit as a pleasant surprise. The real estate agent said she related to him as someone who was also raised in a single-parent home, and she was impressed with his status as the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second elected black governor.     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has me thinking now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sowers, who is also considering Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. She said if Patrick can get his message out, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s someone voters could see defeating President Donald Trump in 2020 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 her top priority.  Beth Ruffin said she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know much about Patrick before Tuesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s event, but he left her intrigued and wanting to learn more. A former Beto O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Rourke supporter, she is a voter back on the market since his departure from the presidential race.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounded like strong black women raised him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ruffin, who owns a diversity and inclusion consulting firm and headed out for Patrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second stop at a nearby restaurant, where he was warmly greeted by a crowd of several dozen. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to see how he translates that into policy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  ___  Reach the reporters on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP and http://twitter.com/emarvelous  \\n'"

At the time, Lexus called the vehicle a concept despite looking ready to hit showrooms and streets worldwide.\\nNow, at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the Japanese luxury marque has finally pulled the covers off the production model 2020 LC 500 Convertible.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the LC 500 Convertible looks largely similar to the LC Convertible Concept previewed in January. Most of the design cues has simply been carried over. However, it seems the more stylish wheels on the Concept appears to have been ditched in favor of the standard units fitted on the Coupe.\\n\\nStyling-wise, the biggest difference between the Convertible and the standard LC 500 would be the lack of a roof and a revised rear deck. In place of a fixed metal roof and the large backglass is a retractable fabric soft top. Lexus engineers have hidden the frame underneath the material so that it won\\x19t be seen with the roof in place. No doubt the LC 500 Convertible looks very stylish with the roof down. However, some might find it\\x19s roofline a bit strange with the soft-top roof up.\\n\\nShould the weather take a turn for the worse, drivers can operate the folding soft-top to close in just 16 seconds at speeds at up to 50 km/h. Meanwhile, it just takes 15 seconds to fold the roof down and give occupant open-air freshness. The air-conditioning system also automatically adjusts cabin temperature whether the top is up or down. The rest of the cabin has simply been carried over from the coupe.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\n\\nIn order to make up for the lack of a roof, Lexus Project Manager Fumihiko Hazama shared with AutoIndustriya.com that they have improved chassis rigidity by adding x-braces. The front suspension has also been revised in order to reduce unsprung weight. At the rear, the suspension brace has been relocated and reshaped in order to improve structural rigidity.\\n\\nUnder the hood, it\\x19s the same 5.0-liter V8 engine which produces 471 horsepower and 540 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. To hear the V8 better, a pipe channels engine noise into the cabin.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nThe Lexus LC 500 Convertible will go on sale in summer 2020.

While Chromecast users enjoy the game at a reasonably solid 30fps with 4K output, those who play through the Chrome browser will experience an unstable 1080p 60fps.Interesting to see Stadia RDR2 capture out there running at an unstable 60fps.

A spokesperson who did not wish to be named because of agency policy said in a statement emailed to NBC News that the agency never has administered vaccines and people aren\\'t usually held in custody very long.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Lucy Nicholson Detainees at Otay Mesa immigration detention center in San Diego, Calif., on May 18, 2018.\\n\"As a law enforcement agency and due to the short term nature of CBP holding and other logistical challenges, operating a vaccine program is not feasible,\" the spokesperson said. Although CBP\\x19s guidelines recommend holding people no longer than 72 hours, the agency has been holding people far longer as arrivals of migrants seeking asylum spiked last year and this year, although they have since fallen.\"We write with urgency\"In a Nov. 5 letter to Kevin McAleenan, who was the acting director of the Department of Homeland Security and Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, said they would provide 100 doses of the influenza vaccines and four volunteer physicians to administer them. McAleenan resigned and Chad Wolf has been named new DHS acting secretary.\"This is how epidemics begin,\" Dr. Luz Contreras Arroyo, a member of the group and signatory to the letter, told NBC News. \"It\\'s not just migrants. Workers will come out to communities, potentially spreading that virus and it could get out of control.\"\"These are people as well,\" Arroyo added, speaking of the detained families. \"They are under the care of the government, most not having committed crimes. Seeking asylum is not a crime.\"The group had set a deadline of Tuesday for the administration to respond before making the request public.The doctors warned that migrants are not the only people at risk of illness.\"Flu season has already begun in many parts of the country, so we write with urgency,\" the doctors stated. \"Many people, including those working at and living near CBP facilities, will be at an even higher risk than what is typical.\"The doctors contributed money and raised more from friends and others to pay the cost of the vaccines. Physicians are volunteering their time to provide the shots, said Arroyo, a Sacramento family medicine physician and psychiatrist.The doctors said they also have an established volunteer network of physicians licensed to operate in all states to get the necessary vaccines and work with CBP to \\x1ccreate a system to ensure that the majority of migrant families\\x1d held in CBP custody are vaccinated.They hope for government funding to help pay the cost for vaccines systemwide. If not, they will try to find other funding.\"Alarming mortality rate\"The doctors said that based on an estimated 200,000 children in federal custody in the past two years, the three deaths of detained children attributed to complications from the flu are nine times higher than the expected death rate for children from flu.\\x1cIn our professional medical opinion, this alarming mortality rate constitutes an emergency which threatens the safety of human lives, particularly children,\\x1d says the letter signed by seven physicians.In August, CBP announced that it would not be vaccinating migrant families in its holding centers ahead of the flu season. At the time, the agency said in a statement that it chose not to provide the vaccinations because of the \\x1cshort-term\\x1d stays of immigrants in custody and the complexities of operating a vaccination program.But Arroyo said the government has done wide scale vaccinations before and given out large amounts of vaccine to prevent illness from spreading and prevent epidemics. She said it is cost effective and less than the cost of hospitals and ICUs for detainees, staff and residents once they become sick.CBP\\'s cells and pens of chain-link fence with concrete floors and holding rooms are known to be very cold and are often called hieleras, which translates to freezer or icebox, by those held in them, which include infant children.Health care providers have protested longer detention periods for migrants, warning that children in particular would face more serious health risks with the extended incarcerations.Overcrowded conditions worsen riskThe doctors offering to operate the flu vaccination clinic noted findings of overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at detention facilities by the DHS Office of Inspector General.That report found children in some CBP facilities didn\\x19t have access to showers, didn\\x19t always have opportunities to change clothes and that they had limited space for medical isolation. In an El Paso facility, a cell meant for 35 held 155 adult males with only one toilet and sink, NBC News reported.A flu outbreak at the CBP McAllen facility affected nearly three dozen immigrants and required a temporary suspension of operations.The Centers for Disease Control recommends all individuals above age 6 months get a flu vaccine by the end of October for the current flu season. Even the policy manual of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department, notes the CDC requirement that immigrants be vaccinated for flu.\\x1cAs physicians, we have seen the effects of flu infections in the strongest as well as the most vulnerable, and the outcomes can be devastating,\\x1d the physicians stated.Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'  In July 2018, we recommended a $5.1 million grant to Evidence Action Beta to create a program dedicated to developing potential GiveWell top charities by prototyping, testing, and scaling programs which have the potential to be highly impactful and cost-effective. \\nThis grant was made as part of GiveWell\\x19s Incubation Grants program, which aims to support potential future GiveWell top charities and to help grow the pipeline of organizations we can consider for a recommendation. Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we work closely.\\nSummary\\nThis post will discuss the following:\\n\\n Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More)\\n Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More)\\n Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta\\x19s work going forward. (More)\\n\\nIncubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up: \\n\\nA key part of GiveWell\\x19s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create & [an] incubator & focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\\nWe have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, & our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\\nWe believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling & promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\\n\\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta\\x19s parent organization, Evidence Action, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water). \\nModeling cost-effectiveness\\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant\\x19s cost-effectiveness.\\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could. \\nThis could occur:\\n\\n if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\\n if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities\\x14in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities\\x19 funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities\\x19 funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\\n\\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn\\x19t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly. We register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta\\x19s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here.)\\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research. \\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\\nRisks to the success of the grant\\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\\n\\nFew programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell\\x19s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\\nWe expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\\n\\nGoing forward\\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely. \\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.  \\n'"

Democratic presidential candidate South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks during a fundraiser for the Nevada Democratic Party, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2019, in Las Vegas. \\n  Photo: John Locher, AP            7 key questions heading into the 2020 Democratic debate   \\n\\n    WASHINGTON (AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 New uncertainty hangs over the Democratic presidential primary as 10 candidates meet on the debate stage once again.  No longer is there a clear front-runner. The fight for African American voters is raging. And there are growing concerns that impeachment may become a distraction from the primary. Those issues and more will play out Wednesday night when the Democratic Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top 10 face off in Atlanta just 75 days before primary voting begins.  Seven big questions heading into the debate, to be carried on MSNBC:  WHO IS THE FRONT-RUNNER?  Turbulent polling across the early voting states has created a murky picture of the top tier of the 2020 class. As much as Joe Biden is still a front-runner, so are Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. The question is who gets the front-runner treatment in Wednesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debate. Warren was under near-constant attack last month as a new leader. Will Warren continue to face the heat, or will the ascendant Buttigieg or weakening Biden take more hits?      ___   HOW WILL OBAMA PLAY?  Former President Barack Obama, the most popular Democrat in America, inserted himself into the 2020 primary in recent days by warning candidates against moving too far to the left. His comments create a challenge for Warren and Sanders and an opening for moderates Buttigieg, Biden and Amy Klobuchar to attack. At the same time, Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement offers a powerful reminder of the massive role African Americans will play in the presidential nomination process. As we know, all candidates not named Biden have serious work to do when it comes to winning over the black vote. Race and Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legacy could play a major role in shaping the action.   ___  WHAT SAY YOU, IMPEACHMENT JURY?  They have all come out in favor of impeachment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some more aggressively than others \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s noteworthy that five of the 10 Democrats on stage will serve as jurors in the Senate impeachment trial should the House vote to impeach President Donald Trump. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a complicated topic for Democrats. Some senators worry that a prospective impeachment trial will interfere with their ability to court voters early next year. Others fear that impeachment could hurt their party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more vulnerable candidates in down-ballot elections next year. Either way, what the prospective jurors do or don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say on the debate stage could be relevant if and when the Senate holds an impeachment trial, which is increasingly likely.     ___  WILL THEY BASH THE BILLIONAIRES?  Never before has wealth been under such aggressive attack in a presidential primary election. And with one billionaire onstage and another likely to join the field in the coming days, the billionaire bashing could reach new heights. Tom Steyer has largely gone under the radar, but the even wealthier Michael Bloomberg has generated tremendous buzz as he steps toward a run of his own. Of the two, only Steyer will be on stage, but expect Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shadow in particular to generate passionate arguments about wealth and the role of money in politics.  ___  WILL SOMEONE STAND UP FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT?  Biden continues to be the favorite of many establishment Democrats, but his underwhelming candidacy has created an opening for another pragmatic-minded Democrat to step up. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Bloomberg are moving into the race. Buttigieg stepped aggressively into the establishment lane in the last debate, but many donors and elected officials remain skeptical of the 37-year-old small-city mayor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chances. The opportunity is there for lower-tier candidates including Kamala Harris, Klobuchar and Steyer.  ___  DOES SHE HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT?  No single issue has dominated the initial Democratic primary debates more than health care, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safe to assume that will be the case again Wednesday night. And no one has more riding on that specific debate than Warren, who hurt herself last month by stumbling through questions about the cost of her single-payer health care plan. Given that policy specifics make up the backbone of her candidacy, she can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford another underwhelming performance on the defining policy debate of the primary season. Expect the policy-minded senator to have a new strategy this time around.  ___  CAN THEY SAVE THEMSELVES?  New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, businessman Andrew Yang and Steyer are under enormous pressure to break out given their status as the only candidates onstage who haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet qualified for the December debate. They likely won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the same number of opportunities to speak as their higher-polling rivals, but these are dire times for the underdogs. They need to do something if they expect to stay relevant in the 2020 conversation.  ___  Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGround Game.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'South Korea\\x19s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has unveiled a plan to help the PV industry further reduce the costs of solar module technology and to increase product efficiency.The initiative is part of the Fourth Energy Technology Development Plan and Roadmap, submitted to Korean renewable energy industry representatives this week. The plan includes actions to raise electromobility rates, reduce coal-fired fine dusts by 90%, improve nuclear safety and increase the scale of wind power projects, among other measures.Sixteen energy technology priorities identified by MOTIE in the roadmap include a reduction in solar module costs from around $0.23/W today to $0.10 by 2030, helped by unspecified research and development investment. As a way of rough comparison, the SunShot Initiative launched by the U.S. government in 2011 aims to reduce the price of the solar electricity generated by large scale projects to $0.03/kWh by 2030. In September 2017, the Department of Energy announced the $0.06/kWh benchmark of that ambition had been achieved three years early.Module efficiencyThe South Korean government also wants to help manufacturers increase solar module efficiency from around 20% now to 24% by the end of the next decade. Seoul expects PV cell producers to increase the average efficiency of multi-junction devices from 23% to 35%.No details were provided on how the industrial and technological targets would be achieved.The plan appears consistent with another announced by MOTIE in March, which aimed to introduce carbon footprint certification rules, minimum efficiency levels and industrial standards for solar and wind power. Those planned guidelines are yet to see the light of day.Domestic industryA recent report by the International Energy Agency\\x19s Photovoltaic Power Systems Program stated the South Korean solar module industry had an annual production capacity of around 8.69 GW at the end of 2017. Hanwha Q Cells had 3.7 GW of cell capacity and the same volume of module operations at that point and LG Electronics had 3 GW of output, also evenly split between cells and modules. A further 17 manufacturers, according to the report, had production operations ranging from 30-600 MW.However, the reduction in demand seen after Beijing attempted to rein in public solar subsidies at the end of May last year ensures some of that 8.69 GW of Korean production lines may have since been idled or closed altogether.South Korea also hosts several polysilicon manufacturers, including the OCI Group and Hanwha Q Cells parent Hanwha Group. That industry too is suffering from oversupply and anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports by the Chinese government since July 2013.Despite the manufacturing setbacks introduced by its regional neighbor and solar giant,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdSouth Korea is seeing stronger than ever solar project deployment. According to data released by MOTIE in August, newly installed capacity for the first seven months of the year reached 1.64 GW and Seoul plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. That ambitious target is expected to be achieved with giant solar parks such as a recently announced 2.1 GW floating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array planned in the Saemangeum area and announced by president Moon Jae-in a year ago.\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'\\nBreaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening trade war.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great betrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019. \"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we\\'re taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States\\x19 leverage after massive job losses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of Trump\\x19s tariff decisions.\\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary victims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while tariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University\\x19s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like any tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the trading relationship poorer \\x14 not richer.\"\\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger fraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the United States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the world.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd When the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn\\x19t foreign exporters that make the payment. The importers do, and they\\x19re usually U.S. companies.\\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer \\x14 say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written. \"The Chinese government pays nothing.\"\\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don\\x19t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are high enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It\\x19s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality. Revenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through June 30, 2019.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nThat\\x19s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs. For context, that\\x19s less than 2% of annual federal revenues.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two years. As we\\x19ve noted, a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods, \"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era tariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by 2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on economic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while lowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent jobs.\\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too. Facing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China\\x19s gross domestic product.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd It started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed by steel and aluminum in March 2018.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery, followed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics, more machinery, and electrical equipment.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018, affecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods. Tariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the list of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes, shoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including many food products.\\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a wide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade Partnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Retaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may have had an impact as well.)\\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.\\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely, a Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S. are computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps, and semiconductors, have seen price increases, harming U.S. producers. \"When the price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete against non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.\\n\\n'"

The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man\\'s symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.The man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"Related: 7 Strange Signs You\\'re Having an Allergic ReactionHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal.

The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man\\'s lungs.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man\\'s feather bedding.

The patient was diagnosed with what\\'s called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.Feather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body\\'s immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung\\'s air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I\\'m sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What\\'s more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer\\'s lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker\\'s lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"The patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\"It doesn\\'t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdIt\\'s important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWhen doctors don\\'t consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.That being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn\\'t panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.The findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports.Originally published on Live Science.Want more science?

        "articleBody": "b'\\x1cI think I even famously said something to my postdoc adviser, like, \\x18I don\\x19t even know that I can trust this data, you know?\\x19\\x1d Pluznick recalled. \\x1cOlfactory receptors in the kidney? Come on.\\x1d\\nThis wasn\\x19t the first time these receptors had shown up in unexpected tissues. For example, in 2005, the University of Liverpool biochemist Soraya Shirazi-Beechey showed in a paper published in Biochemical Society Transactions that taste receptors could be found in the small intestine as well as the mouth. Their presence was surprising, but it made a certain sense that the intestine might use a taste receptor to monitor the food it was digesting.\\nBut then in 2010, the laboratory of Stephen Liggett, who was then at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, reported that smooth muscle in the airways of the lungs expresses receptors for bitter taste. Moreover, they showed that these receptors were involved in a dilation response of the airways that helped to clear out obstructions. Receptors for sweetness also turned up on the cells lining the airways. In 2012, a research group led by Herbert\\x19s colleague Noam Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania found that the sugars coating the respiratory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa activated those receptors and caused the cells to beat their hairlike cilia more rapidly, a process that can sweep away invading bacteria and prevent infections.\\nMeanwhile, Pluznick and her colleagues had continued to study the role of the Olfr78 receptor in the kidneys. They demonstrated in 2013 that it responded to molecules secreted by intestinal microorganisms, and that signals from that response helped to direct the kidney\\x19s secretion of the hormone renin, which regulates blood pressure. \\x1cOther labs finding similar things in other tissues was both very encouraging and very exciting,\\x1d Pluznick said.\\nThese studies and a torrent of others from labs around the world drove\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhome the message that these seemingly misplaced olfactory and taste receptors serve important and often vital functions. And a theme common to many of those functions was that the chemosensory receptors often seemed to be alerting tissues to the presence and condition of microbes in the body. In hindsight, that application for the receptors made a lot of sense. For example, as Herbert notes, being able to \\x1ctaste\\x1d and \\x1csmell\\x1d minute traces of pathogens gives the body more chances to respond to infections before microbes overwhelm the host\\x19s defenses.\\nA Job for Tuft Cells\\nIn researchers\\x19 assays for chemosensory receptors in tissues throughout the body, a cell type that kept popping up was a relatively rare, largely unstudied one called a tuft cell. Tuft cells had been known to science since the mid-1950s, when microscopy studies found them in the lining of practically every organ in the body, including the gut, the lungs, the nasal passages, the pancreas and the gallbladder. The passage of a half-century, however, hadn\\x19t led to any greater understanding of what tuft cells do. The further discovery of taste receptors on many tuft cells only deepened the mystery: Given their locations in the body, they certainly weren\\x19t contributing to our sense of taste.\\nAs a postdoc at Harvard University in the lab of Wendy Garrett in 2011, Michael Howitt became fascinated with tuft cells, especially those found in the intestines. \\x1cThey were these really intriguing, weird cells that didn\\x19t really have a clear function in terms of the normal physiology,\\x1d said Howitt, who is now an immunologist at Stanford University. He set out to learn the enigmatic cells\\x19 function, and he eventually got his answer \\x14 through an unexpected discovery involving the mouse microbiome. Because some studies had hinted at a link between taste receptors and immune function, Howitt wondered whether the receptor-studded tuft cells in the intestines might respond to the microbiome population of bacteria living in the gut. To find out, he turned to a strain of mice that other Harvard researchers had bred to lack a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.\\nBut surprisingly, when he inspected a small sample of intestinal tissue from the mice, Howitt found that they had 18 times the number of tuft cells previously reported. When he looked more closely, he found that the mice carried more protozoa in their guts than expected \\x14 specifically, a common single-celled parasite called Tritrichomonas muris.\\nHowitt realized that T. muris wasn\\x19t an accidental infection but rather a normal part of the microbiome in mice \\x14 something that neither he nor Garrett had thought much about. \\x1cWe weren\\x19t looking for protozoa,\\x1d Howitt said. \\x1cWe were focused on bacteria.\\x1d\\nTo confirm the relationship between the presence of the protozoa and the elevated numbers of tuft cells, Howitt ordered another set of similarly pathogen-free mice from a different breeding facility and fed them some of the protozoan-rich intestinal contents of the Harvard mice. The number of tuft cells in the new mice soared as the parasites colonized their intestines, too. The numbers of tuft cells also climbed when Howitt infected mice with parasitic worms. But the increase didn\\x19t happen in mice with defects in the biochemical pathways underpinning their taste receptors, including those on the tuft cells.\\nHowitt\\x19s findings were significant because they pointed to a possible role for tuft cells in the body\\x19s defenses \\x14 one that would fill a conspicuous hole in immunologists\\x19 understanding. Scientists understood quite a bit about how the immune system detects bacteria and viruses in tissues. But they knew far less about how the body recognizes invasive worms, parasitic protozoa and allergens, all of which trigger so-called type 2 immune responses. Howitt and Garett\\x19s work suggested that tuft cells might act as sentinels, using their abundant chemosensory receptors to sniff out the presence of these intruders. If something seems wrong, the tuft cells could send signals to the immune system and other tissues to help coordinate a response.\\nAt the same time that Howitt was working, Locksley and his postdoc Jakob von Moltke (who now runs his own lab at the University of Washington) were homing in on that\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfinding from another direction by studying some of the chemical signals (cytokines) involved in allergies. Locksley had discovered a group of cells called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete these cytokines. ILC2s, he found, release cytokines after receiving a signal from a chemical called IL-25. Locksley and von Moltke used a fluorescent tag to mark intestinal cells that produced IL-25. The only cells that gave off a red glow in their experiments were tuft cells. Locksley had barely even heard of them.\\n\\x1cEven textbooks of [gastrointestinal] medicine had no idea what these cells did,\\x1d he said. The Howitt-Garrett and Locksley-von Moltke papers were prominently featured in Science and Nature, respectively. Together with a third paper in Nature by Philippe Jay of the Institute for Functional Genomics at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and his colleagues, these studies provided the first explanation for what tuft cells do: They recognize parasites by means of a small molecule called succinate, an end product of parasite metabolism. Once succinate binds to a tuft cell, it triggers the release of IL-25, which alerts the immune system to the problem. As part of the defensive cascade, the IL-25 also helps to initiate the production of mucus by nearby goblet cells and triggers muscle contractions to remove the parasites from the gut.\\nFor the first time, biologists had found at least one explanation for what tuft cells do. Before this, \\x1cpeople just kind of ignored them or didn\\x19t even realize that they were there,\\x1d said Megan Baldridge, a molecular microbiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\\nAs groundbreaking as this trio of studies was, the work focused on intestinal cells. No one knew at first whether the tuft cells appearing elsewhere throughout the body play the same anti-parasitic role. Answers soon began to roll in, and it became clear that tuft cells respond to more than succinate and do more than help repel the body\\x19s invaders. In the thymus (a small globular outpost of the immune system nestled behind the breastbone), tuft cells help teach the immune system\\x19s maturing T cells the difference between self proteins and non-self proteins. Kathleen DelGiorno, now a staff scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, helped to show that tuft cells can help protect against pancreatic cancer by detecting cellular injury. And in Cohen\\x19s studies of chronic nasal and sinus infection, he discovered that recognition of bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa by receptors for bitterness on tuft cells causes neighboring cells to pump out microbe-killing chemicals.\\nAs a lung biologist and a colleague of Herbert\\x19s at the University of Pennsylvania, Andrew Vaughan followed these tuft-cell discoveries with interest. In many cases, tuft cells appeared to be intimately involved with the part of the immune response known as inflammation. Vaughan was studying how tissue deep in the lungs repairs itself after inflammation caused by the flu virus. After reading about some of the new findings, Vaughan began to wonder whether tuft cells might be involved in the lungs\\x19 recovery from influenza. He and Herbert infected mice with the influenza virus and searched the lungs of those with severe symptoms for signs of tuft cells.\\n\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b' The core stage of the first SLS at Michoud Assembly Facility after the installation in early November of its four RS-25 engines. (credit: NASA/Jude Guidry) \\n\\n  \\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocket\\x19s core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a \\x1cGreen Run\\x1d test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.\\n \\x1cIf NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,\\x1d Cooke said. \\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA\\x19s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.\\n \\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn\\x19t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.\\n \\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration\\x19s own party in Congress. \\x1cEvery space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,\\x1d said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee\\x19s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA\\x19s exploration plans.\\n \\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA\\x19s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)\\n \\n\\x1cWhile I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,\\x1d he continued.\\n \\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA\\x19s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA\\x19s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\\n \\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. \\x1cThe fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,\\x1d said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cooke\\x19s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.)\\n \\x1cIf you don\\x19t have a big booster, you\\x19re not going to make it,\\x1d Stafford said of returning to the Moon. \\n\\x1cSLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,\\x1d he continued. \\x1cIf NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.\\x1d He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbit\\x14no Gateway required.\\n \\nAt last week\\x19s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety.\\n \\n\\x1cThe mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,\\x1d Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke\\x19s earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. \\x1cI cannot disagree with it.\\x1d\\n \\n\\x1cBut with eight launches, I\\x19ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,\\x1d he concluded.\\n \\n\\x1cOh my,\\x1d Lucas responded with a sigh.\\n \\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. \\x1cIf you don\\x19t have a big booster, you\\x19re not going to make it,\\x1d he said. \\x1cYou have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you don\\x19t have it, you\\x19re not going to make it.\\x1d\\n \\nYoung, in his testimony, didn\\x19t specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called \\x1cexperiments\\x1d in procurement. \\x1cManaging and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,\\x1d he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program.\\n \\n\\x1cA management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,\\x1d he said. \\x1cI personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.\\x1d\\n \\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. \\x1cThe plate is really full today,\\x1d he said. \\x1cI personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.\\x1d\\n \\nOne thing Young would push off NASA\\x19s plate is the Gateway. \\x1cI do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,\\x1d he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. \\x1cThere\\x19s not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.\\x1d\\n Bridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. \\x1cAdding an additional SLS into the mix could\\x14I\\x19m not confident that could happen.\\x1d \\nLast week\\x19s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASA\\x19s use\\x14or unwillingness to use\\x14the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS.\\n \\n\\x1cI understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,\\x1d he said, including the first Block 1B. \\x1cWhat do you think?\\x1d\\n \\n\\x1cIt depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,\\x1d responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn\\x19t funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\\n \\n\\x1cWe haven\\x19t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we\\x19re guaranteed the second core we\\x19d need for a Moon landing in 2024,\\x1d added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing.\\n \\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. \\x1cAdding an additional SLS into the mix could\\x14I\\x19m not confident that could happen.\\x1d\\n \\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. \\x1cWhat commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?\\x1d\\n \\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman\\x19s OmegA.  \\n\\x1cThere could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,\\x1d Bridenstine added. \\x1cWe\\x19re not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.\\x1d\\n \\n\\x1cWhat is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,\\x1d Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles\\x14or SLS.\\n \\n\\x1cBut if commercial\\x19s not available, what\\x19s the contingency plan?\\x1d Aderholt asked again.\\n \\n\\x1cI think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,\\x1d Bridenstine said. \\x1cIf we don\\x19t have the additional rockets, then we\\x19re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu we\\x19re confident we\\x19ll have those rockets.\\x1d\\n \\x1cIf this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,\\x1d Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis. \\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cooke\\x19s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\\n \\n\\x1cWe\\x19re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,\\x1d Bridenstine said. \\x1cWe\\x19re waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we\\x19ll assess their approaches.\\x1d\\n \\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\\n \\n\\x1cUsing the lift capability of NASA\\x19s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a \\x18Fewest Steps to the Moon\\x19 approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,\\x1d Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\\n \\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the \\x1cnational team\\x1d led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin\\x19s New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.)\\n \\nNASA\\x19s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. Jos\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.\\n \\n\\x1cIt\\x19s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don\\x19t know the costs down the road,\\x1d Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, \\x1cin order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.\\x1d\\n \\nBabin referred to those comments at last week\\x19s hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were \\x1ddwindling.\\x1d\\n \\n\\x1cIf this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,\\x1d he said. \\x1cThis could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.\\x1d\\n \\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA\\x19s architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\\n Jeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

The five companies can now vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to pave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group of companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon\\'s surface drives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers.

And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories.I'm here to tell you that the Laws of Physics apply to online business just like offline business.Click To TweetIt takes time to build a successful business \\x14 offline\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand\\xef\\xbf\\xbdonline.(I know, radical statement, right?)I want you to embrace this reality \\x14 because I\\x19m about to show you how to get time on your side.Trying to build an online business isn\\x19t as simple as lots of people would have you believe. It has its challenges.There\\x19s a lot of technology to master. There\\x19s marketing involved \\x14 a\\xef\\xbf\\xbdlot\\xef\\xbf\\xbdof marketing. Maybe more marketing than you\\x19re comfortable with.And there are all these moving parts \\x14 disparate bits of software that needs to interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly.Today, I\\x19m going to\\xef\\xbf\\xbddemystify the process of building your online business.You\\x19re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it turns out your don\\x19t need to Buy All The Things and Learn All The Things in order to make it online.I developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and error \\x14 mine, and the people I taught.It\\x19s called Plan & Grow BIG.Focus on what really matters in the near future of your businessPlan & Grow BIG\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhelps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might be stopping you from making real progress in your online business.Maybe you\\x19re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you\\x19ve been trying for years to build a business idea you\\x19ve had in your head \\x14 but it just isn\\x19t living up to what you expected.Either way, you\\x19re in the right place because today\\x19s information will help you catapult forward.I developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting sidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they \\x1cneeded\\x1d to master.For example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads \\x14 before they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were going to offer.And I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was proven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an unproven product.)I saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. =ASmart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But they were completely baffled by this \\x1conline business thing.\\x1dTo be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the frustrations myself.True confession: I had to learn business focus the hard wayBefore I outline the Plan & Grow BIG approach and the specifics for each stage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.I\\x19m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.Back in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business, Zurek Design.I had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled projects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also juggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their \\x1claunch\\x1d phases \\x14 they were in high school and starting to look at universities and think about their careers.I didn\\x19t have a lot of time to spare.Plus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become much more of a \\x1cpublic figure\\x1d than I had ever had to be in my business in the past. I\\x19d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And I\\x19d need to \\x1cput myself out there\\x1d on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars, and in online video.Yikes.And although my offline business was making a solid income, my online business idea \\x14 to share my marketing and design training with others \\x14 wasn\\x19t making a single cent.Who in their right mind invests in a business idea\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbefore\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthey know if it will make money?I do, apparently!It turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.Because I did \\x14 I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course called Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time \\x14 an enormous amount of money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.But I\\x19m glad I did.I truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that investment, I was telling myself, \\x1cThis dream matters. This dream is going to become a reality. I\\x19m taking this seriously.\\x1dOnce I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new, things started happening for me.Within a few months, I (the person who didn\\x19t want to be seen online) had an article accepted by the company behind the course I took \\x14 on one of the most-popular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.Then another article went live. And another.Not just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the day.And through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then coaching.Out with the old, in with the new (and better)Within a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline business made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to focus exclusively on my online efforts.Now, I\\x19m considered an authority on building an online presence.That company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach their audience for a couple of years.Here\\x19s what\\x19s different in my life now:My business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas)I am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from meMy books are well-received and much loved \\x14 and deliver income to me every single monthPeople find my website and join my community every day, all year longI\\x19m able to travel anywhere I\\x19d like because my business fits in my backpackI can \\x1cdial up\\x1d or \\x1cdial back\\x1d my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my scheduleHere\\x19s the other important thing &I also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer to no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs whenever I\\x19d like.But this story isn\\x19t about me.What I\\x19m about to share is the exact plan I\\x19ve developed after seeing what truly works online.It\\x19s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A business where I\\x19m in control \\x14 of my time, my projects, my earnings.And that\\x19s what I want for you.Ready to make online business building easier?You wouldn\\x19t have read this far if you didn\\x19t also want to build this kind of online business!That\\x19s why I want to make it easier for you.What is your business focus right now?If you can\\x19t answer that question immediately, read on.How to use Plan & Grow BIG to get the business focus mindset you needThe purpose of the Plan & Grow BIG approach is to help you develop business focus \\x14 and eliminate the feeling of overwhelm that keeps you from making progress.Here\\x19s the thing:I believe the #1 enemy of online progress is the flood of information about online business tactics that bombards us every day.Click To TweetI want to show you how you can ignore most of the information you see!And how developing business focus will allow you to build the business you\\x19re dreaming about much faster \\x14 and with less frustration.To get started, I created a simple quiz and resource doc that will help you get more value from this article.Grab my 12-question quiz that will help you pinpoint the stage you\\x19re in right now \\x14 and get guidance about how to maximize your results.GET THE QUIZ: INSTANT DOWNLOAD!Click the link above so you can:Discover what business-building stage you\\x19re in nowAssess what you\\x19re starting with \\x14 make a list of your current assetsPinpoint what your current business focus should beGet to know\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhat happens in the other business stages \\x14 so you can focusDownload it here so you can apply this to your business:GET THE QUIZ: INSTANT DOWNLOAD!As we go through each stage of the Plan & Grow BIG approach, I want you to identify areas of opportunity for your current situation.Let\\x19s get started.The four simple stages of Plan & Grow BIGThe Plan Stage: Think and dream productivelyIt\\x19s the early days of your business.Think BIG. And work only on what\\x19s needed in this stage.In the PLAN stage, make these your business focus:Pinpoint your ideal customer: Who will your online business serve? Warning: many people try to skip this step \\x14 don\\x19t! You need to become acquainted with the people you want to reach and help before you build your branding and offers.Get your branding in place: The earlier the better when it comes tobuilding your brand. You\\x19ll want to decide your business name andtagline, select your brand colors, and choose your brand fonts.Map out your first offer: Decide how what solutions you\\x19ll deliver and how you\\x19ll deliver them. Will they be products, services, or both?That\\x19s it. Once you\\x19ve completed the items above, it\\x19s time to start building your business, my friend. Ready?The Build Stage: Create a tangible online assetTime to make ideas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdreal.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAs you build these tangible business assets, remember: you don\\x19t have to do it all at once.Focus on these business goals during the BUILD stage:Build your initial website: You\\x19ll need a Homepage, an About page, a Contact page, and some kind of \\x1ccommerce\\x1d page, like a Store or Services page. Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series.Build your first offer: Don\\x19t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that\\x19s relatively simple \\x14 but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that.Build an initial funnel: Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.And now & stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it\\x19s tempting to look around at Version 9.0 of your competitors\\x19 sites and feel like you have to catch up to them.Nonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and be proud you\\x19re ready to move on &The Implement Stage: Iterate to find what worksOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can feel deeply uncomfortable.But growth usually\\xef\\xbf\\xbddoes\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfeel uncomfortable, doesn\\x19t it?The IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that\\x19s perfectly fine. Here\\x19s what you\\x19ll focus on while you\\x19re there:Make your offers live: Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great \\x14 but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs.Focus on building your email list. Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list \\x14 think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a referral network.Discover what works for launching your products and services. Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.Remember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to develop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business. Patience, my friend!But once you\\x19ve hit on a winning product or service, you\\x19ll be ready for &The Grow Stage: Leverage your successIn the GROW stage, you\\x19ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably in your business \\x14 and now you\\x19ll focus on leveraging that success.Improve your conversion rates: Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what\\x19s working. You\\x19ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible.Add more revenue streams: As you dial into what\\x19s working well, you may uncover your customers\\x19 unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You\\x19ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.The GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are reliable and you\\x19re able to make some serious investments in your business.Ready? Set?

        "articleBody": "b' WASHINGTON \\x13 Two federal prison officers were charged Tuesday with falsifying records, stating\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthey had checked on\\xef\\xbf\\xbdaccused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in the hours before he hanged himself in\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhis Manhattan cell. Federal prosecutors alleged that Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, assigned to Epstein\\'s special housing unit at Metropolitan Correctional Center, \"browsed the Internet,\" lingered in an office\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcommon area and appeared to sleep for two hours when they should have been conducting inmate checks. Noel and Thomas signed \"false certifications\" attesting they had made their required rounds, according to court records. Prosecutors alleged that no inmate checks were made from 10:30 p.m. Aug.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd9 to\\xef\\xbf\\xbd6:30 a.m. the following morning, when the officers discovered Epstein\\'s body. During that time, the officers should have conducted\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfive separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\x1cAs alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,\\x1d Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\x1cInstead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.\\x1d Each defendant is\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcharged with one count of conspiring to\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfalsify records. Noel, 31,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three. The conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years. Noel and Thomas pleaded not guilty\\xef\\xbf\\xbdin Manhattan federal court\\xef\\xbf\\xbdTuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week. Epstein\\'s sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhis trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges. His suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdAttorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and\\xef\\xbf\\xbdordered\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmultiple investigations into the 66-year-old\\'s suicide,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfocusing on\\xef\\xbf\\xbdoperations at the Manhattan\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfacility where Epstein was held. Indictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before\\xef\\xbf\\xbdCongress\\xef\\xbf\\xbd As\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein\\'s suicide. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system. \"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhow the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won\\'t be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Prosecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhis homes\\xef\\xbf\\xbdin Manhattan and\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPalm Beach, Florida, and at other locations\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfrom at least 2002 to 2005.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Sasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue. \"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they\\x19re not the end of this.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \"These guards aren\\x19t the only ones who should stand trial \\x13\\xef\\xbf\\xbdevery one of Jeffrey Epstein\\x19s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,\\x1d Sasse said. Hawk Sawyer said she couldn\\'t comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department\\'s inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had. \"We don\\'t want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein\\'s death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\" Although representatives of Epstein\\'s family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports\\xef\\xbf\\xbdanything other than suicide. Internal memo: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts Investigators\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfocused on how Epstein had the\\xef\\xbf\\xbdopportunity to hang himself Before New York\\'s chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhanged himself with a bedsheet, his\\xef\\xbf\\xbddeath was\\xef\\xbf\\xbdshadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered. For months, federal authorities examined\\xef\\xbf\\xbdthe conduct of the staffers assigned to\\xef\\xbf\\xbdEpstein\\'s unit and how he\\xef\\xbf\\xbdescaped notice. Tuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein\\'s housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein\\'s body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks. \"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn\\'t do any rounds.\" Roughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters\\x19 questions. Defense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. \\x1cIt is our hope that we\\x19ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,\\x1d said Jason Foy, who represents Noel.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Montell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would \\x1cruin his life.\\x1d \\x1cWe had hoped that the U.S. Attorney\\x19s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,\\x1d Figgins said. Sometimes employees don\\'t follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they\\x19re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they\\x19re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?\\x1d Figgins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\x1cWhen all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you\\x19ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.\\x1d Prisons plagued by understaffing Prison union\\xef\\xbf\\xbdrepresentatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcompromised\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsecurity at the Manhattan facility. Staffers \\'don\\'t care\\': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein\\'s death in a New York detention center At the time of Epstein\\'s suicide, there were more than 30 staff\\xef\\xbf\\xbdvacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers\\' union.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPrison officials\\xef\\xbf\\xbdregularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said. Ten of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdshift, the one on which\\xef\\xbf\\xbdEpstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdOn the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime. After Epstein\\'s death, Barr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdreassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and\\xef\\xbf\\xbdprison officials placed Noel and Thomas\\xef\\xbf\\xbdon administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhad worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein\\'s unit. Hawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system. Many of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd After the hearing,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public\\x19s trust in us.\\x1d Epstein\\'s inner circle eyed:\\xef\\xbf\\xbdJeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could still go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls    Epstein removed from suicide watch Three weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring\\xef\\xbf\\xbd days later, which has drawn investigative interest.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Experts on jail suicide\\xef\\xbf\\xbdtold USA TODAY that an inmate can\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbe removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate\\xef\\xbf\\xbdis no\\xef\\xbf\\xbdlonger at risk for attempting suicide. \\x1cWhen removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego. Boesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he\\xef\\xbf\\xbdexperienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt. Jack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein\\x19s accusers, said he\\'s pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\n\\x1cForty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.\\x1d Contributing: Kristine Phillips \\n'"

Ascom\\x19s Unite Connect for clinical systems recently received FDA clearance for sales and distribution in the US. It is also available in Canada.\\nThe joint clinical alarm management solution extends the reach of patient alarms generated by Dr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdger\\x19s patient monitoring system to mobile caregivers. The alert message provides critical data and related contextual information right to the caregiver\\x19s mobile device. The mobile delivery of waveform images adds a contextual dimension by helping increase awareness of the patient\\x19s condition and helping nurses distinguish between artifacts, false alarms, and real alarms. Patients benefit from quicker response times to events.\\nAlready in use at European hospitals in France, Belgium and Norway, Ascom\\x19s Unite Connect for clinical systems is a software application utilizing customizable alarm filters to help minimize non-actionable alerts which can cause workflow bottlenecks. Nurses can then focus more effectively on patient care rather than responding to alerts that do not require action. These alert notification messages are intended as a secondary notification system to inform caregivers of patient events captured by these clinical systems and do not replace the primary alarm functions on the monitors.\\nSteve Menet, Senior Vice President of Sales for Dr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdger, Inc., says: \\x1cEffective clinical alarm management continues to be a high focus for health systems and hospitals. As the use of mobile technologies expands in healthcare, so does the opportunity to extend alarm management to mobile caregivers. Our new solution with Ascom provides customers the opportunity to communicate actionable patient information from our Infinity patient monitoring systems to clinicians, while filtering out nuisance alarms that contribute to alarm fatigue.\\x1d\\nRob Goldman, President Ascom North America, says: \\x1cBy collaborating with Dr\\xef\\xbf\\xbdger, Ascom can help hospitals supplement and enhance their alarm management solutions. Leveraging Unite Connect for clinical systems\\x19 customizable alarm filtering helps mobile caregivers avoid unnecessary work interruptions, limiting their exposure to low-priority, routine alerts and helping reduce caregiver alarm fatigue.\\x1d\\n\\n\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'    Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionWho is Julian Assange?\\nProsecutors in Sweden have dropped an investigation into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange in 2010.Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012.The 48-year-old Australian was evicted in April and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions.He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London.The Swedish investigation had been shelved in 2017 but was re-opened earlier this year following his eviction from the embassy.Separately, the US is seeking Assange\\'s extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010.What did the prosecutors say?Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson took the decision to \"discontinue the investigation regarding Julian Assange\", the Swedish Prosecution Authority said.\"The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question,\" it added.  Image caption  Eva-Marie Persson said the decision had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses   Ms Persson said: \"I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events. \"Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation.\"   Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionJulian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London\\nProsecutors told reporters the decision to drop the inquiry had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses in the case. One chapter over, another barely begunCaroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondentWith the end of Julian Assange\\'s legal troubles in Sweden, one long chapter in the saga is over. But another one, in the United States, has barely begun. The Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police.Now Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail.From behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there\\'ll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US. What was the Swedish investigation about?Assange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual.He also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out.What has the reaction been?There was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation.Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: \"Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.\"What charges does Assange face in the US?Australian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years.In June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an extradition request from the US.   Image caption  Assange gestures with a thumbs up after he was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London   Assange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving the custody period of his jail term.But a judge ruled that Assange should remain in jail until his extradition hearing because of his \"history of absconding\".Last month, a judge rejected Assange\\'s attempt to delay the full extradition hearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate\\'s Court in London in February. \\n'"

In the end, we will win and save our Country from certain destruction,\\x1d Trump tweeted soon after the House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public impeachment hearings on Tuesday.\\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer Williams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison, another top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\\n\"Today\\'s second hearing is over, and the Democrats\\x19 central allegation in this impeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\\n\\x1cSpecifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no indication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating his previous deposition testimony that \\x18there was no linkage like that,\" she said.\\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the Democrats.\\n\\x1cWith the Democrats\\x19 poll-tested \\x18quid-pro-quo\\x19 and \\x18bribery\\x19 narratives in shambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for one more second,\\x1d Grisham said.\\n\\x1cWe have learned nothing new in today\\'s illegitimate \\x18impeachment\\x19 proceedings. However, buried among the witnesses\\x19 personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was \\x18accurate\\x19 and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to \\x18bribery\\x19 or any other crime,\\x1d she added.\\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for President Trump.\\n\\x1cToday\\'s hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats are simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election,\\x1d Grisham said.\\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump\\x19s request to Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with American national security goals.\\n\\x1cFrankly I couldn\\'t believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security,\\x1d Vindman said.\\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\\n\\x1cI believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president\\'s reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different than other calls I had listened to,\\x1d she said.\\n\\x1cI thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature given that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,\\x1d Williams said.\\n\\x1cI can\\'t speak to what the president\\'s motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,\\x1d she said in response to a question.\\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are they\\'re not things that one should be pursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\\n\\x1cWe should be supporting Ukraine\\'s democracy, reforms, and its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities.

        "articleBody": "b' How do you shop for a tech-savvy person who buys the latest of everything before the holidays arrive? I am totally that person for my family when it comes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store gift cards and another\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHomePod, but stocking stuffers and expensive smart speakers aren\\x19t always the right gift.\\nThat\\x19s why I\\x19m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different. Last year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home products, and most of those picks are still applicable.\\nBut there\\x19s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I\\x19ve received for testing \\x14 new technology that I\\x19m super glad to see exist. Read on to see my favorite picks for new tech that I\\x19m grateful for this year. Satechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C on MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple laptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook would struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs. A better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage, and now it\\x19s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwhile charging in the car.\\n\\nSatechi\\x19s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I\\x19ve tested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It features two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you charge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro \\x14 even during use.\\nIt\\x19s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I\\x19m still amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro when just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery percentage while charging.\\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and another with dual 18W USB-C PD ports, but neither match the 60W output from Satechi.\\nRAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\\nIt\\x19s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year \\x14 not in terms of power delivery but in miniaturization.\\nThanks to new GaN (gallium nitride) charging bricks, you can find fast and reliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than what Apple includes in the box.\\n\\nRAVPower\\x19s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I\\x19ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away from owning a third.\\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact that it\\x19s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple\\x19s chargers pleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials USB-C charging cable, available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my top tech discoveries this year.\\nMophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat project first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to fill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\\nWhile no one has matched Apple\\x19s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless charging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that stands out.\\n\\nMophie\\x19s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot for charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging Case, and iPhone 8 or later. It\\x19s not cheap at $140, but it\\x19s very nice to own and makes for a great gift.\\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a couple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my nightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\\n\\nPrior to Mophie\\x19s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad\\x19s version (pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience, but I prefer the tighter design of Mophie\\x19s personally. If you don\\x19t need the Apple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless charging mat\\xef\\xbf\\xbdwith a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for $60 less.\\nEven with Apple\\x19s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward this year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods, Apple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless charger on my nightstand.\\nSamsung 4K Smart LED TV\\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn\\x19t expect to ever include a Samsung TV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple introduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending audio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV shows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and even watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple TV Channels.\\n\\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed over to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try. That turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for $278.\\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200\\xef\\xbf\\xbdbefore\\xef\\xbf\\xbdyou factor the cost of a new TV.\\n\\nI\\x19ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since AirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly recommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room without spending a fortune.\\nLinksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next generation of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this year.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than 802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take advantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery between multiple mesh routers).\\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices with Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we\\x19re sure to see more Apple hardware join next year.\\n\\nIf you\\x19re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to treat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a future pick this year that you can buy now.\\nI\\x19ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400, currently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and early results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as your tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh bang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop\\xef\\xbf\\xbdWi-Fi 5 mesh router two-pack.\\nLogitech MX Master 3 Mouse\\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse that came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek part.\\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn\\x19t want to buy the same mouse again only to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much that I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was somehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\\n\\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed $99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse. I received one for testing alongside the $99\\xef\\xbf\\xbdLogitech\\x19s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great pair.\\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and charge over USB-C (Apple\\x19s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same charger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\\n\\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX Master 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys wireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple\\x19s standalone Magic Keyboard.\\nThen there\\x19s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse and keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro\\xef\\xbf\\xbdand\\xef\\xbf\\xbdmy iPad Pro, and switching between which device I\\x19m using is as easy as a button press. Highly recommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro even further.\\nBrydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before the end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing board with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned keyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it\\x19s not the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or Smart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in my house.\\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her 12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age \\x14 even after a keyboard repair.\\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for myself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio. iPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible for her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt to her.\\n\\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth, backlit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard case. I haven\\x19t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129, regular $149) since the day she got it.\\nIt may not be\\xef\\xbf\\xbdfor me, but it\\x19s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case among former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\\nLooking for more gift recommendations?

        "articleBody": "b\" SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \\x14 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. was set to begin shutting off power Wednesday to some 375,000 people in 18 Northern and central California counties as the region faces extreme fire weather that\\x19s lasted since October. A virtually rainless fall has left brush bone-dry and forecasts called for low humidity and winds gusting at times to 55 mph (88.5 kph), which might fling tree branches or other debris into power lines, causing sparks that could set catastrophic fires in the region, PG&E officials said. One Napa County reporting station hasn\\x19t seen a measurable drop of rain since mid-September \\x14 the first time that\\x19s happened since 1905, said Scott Strenfel, PG&E's principal meteorologist. The northern Sierra Nevada has seen a fraction of an inch of rain in the past two months instead of the usual 5 inches (127 millimeters), he said. \\x1cThis lack of rain is keeping the threat of fire very real, this late in the season, in many areas,\\x1d said Scott Strenfel, PG&E's principal meteorologist. Ironically, the dry weather up north came as Southern California battened the hatches for a brief but fierce bout of rain. A storm system dumped about 2 inches (50.8 millimeters) of rain in the San Diego County area on Tuesday and more was expected Wednesday. Flash flood watches were in effect for some communities east of Los Angeles, with storm warnings up for mountain communities. Voluntary evacuation warnings were issued for a few communities in an area of Orange and Riverside counties that was burned in a wildfire last year. In the north, however, warnings of extreme fire danger covered a large area. California\\x19s state fire agency placed fire engines and crews in position in some counties and had crews ready to staff aircraft and bulldozers. The planned blackouts will affect counties north of Sacramento, in the northern San Francisco Bay Area, the wine country and Sierra Nevada foothills. The weather should ease by Thursday morning, allowing PG&E to begin restoring power, said Mark Quinlan, PG&E's senior director of emergency preparedness and response. The state\\x19s largest utility decreased the number of people who could be affected from an original estimate of about 660,000 based on updated forecasts and some juggling of its power system. The utility said it will closely monitor the weather and could further reduce that number if it improves. The planned blackout would be the latest in a series of massive outages by the country\\x19s largest utility, including one last month that affected nearly 2.5 million people and outraged local officials and customers who accused the utility of overkill and using blackouts as a crutch because it failed to harden its equipment to withstand fire weather. The outages have been \\x1cterribly disruptive\\x1d and PG&E is taking steps to avoid them in the future but at the moment, \\x1cwe won\\x19t roll the dice on public safety,\\x1d company CEO Andy Vesey said. Meanwhile, California\\x19s utilities regulators are demanding answers from wireless providers whose equipment failed during the power outages, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without a way to get emergency alerts or make 911 calls. The California Public Utilities Commission holds a public hearing Wednesday with executives from AT&T, Comcast/Xfinity, T-Mobile and others. In a letter calling for the meeting, CPUC President Marybel Batjer said that \\x1clack of service is not a mere inconvenience\\x14 it endangers lives.\\x1d She said residents do not have the luxury of failed internet or cellphone connections during a wildfire or other disaster. PG&E initiated four rounds of planned outages in October. More than 450,000 people were without communication, according to a group representing rural counties in California. About half of Marin County\\x19s cell sites were out of service. Consumer advocates are urging the PUC to establish backup power requirements and make the companies provide detailed information about the location of outages. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said in an Oct. 26 letter to communications companies that their level of engagement was \\x1cunacceptable\\x1d at a time when redundant infrastructure is necessary. The utilities commission is frustrated with both communications and utilities companies, saying they failed to share detailed information in real time. Businesses and residents also have complained of poor communications and say that the outages were overly broad and carried out thoughtlessly. \\n\""

        "articleBody": "b' WASHINGTON \\x14 NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a contract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the moon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\\nNASA said the five companies \\x14 Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems \\x14 had been selected to join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for the delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\\nThis \\x1con-ramp\\x1d to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the capability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes NASA\\x19s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission, a rover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south pole of the moon.\\n\\x1cWe were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need to accelerate that,\\x1d Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA\\x19s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a teleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver tools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to delivering science payloads.\\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its Starship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to 100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified amount back to Earth.\\n\\x1cWe do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS program,\\x1d said Shotwell, referring to NASA\\x19s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services effort that funded the development of SpaceX\\x19s commercial cargo capability.\\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such missions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a \\x1cnice stepping stone\\x1d to later crewed missions. She didn\\x19t give a date for crewed missions, but said SpaceX would fly Starship \\x1ca lot\\x1d before flying any missions with people on board.\\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for its small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in May, capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. \\x1cIt has a lot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large, open payload deck,\\x1d said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced development programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the lander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the specifics of each individual CLPS task order.\\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. \\x1cOur company is in a great position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because we build our own satellite systems,\\x1d said John Roth, vice president of business development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads leveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not disclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to start lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company\\x19s CLPS award was a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA\\x19s broader plans. \\x1cSpace exploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire ecosystem of companies,\\x1d he said. \\x1cSmall player being an agility and a creativity that adds to the mix.\\x1d He said his company\\x19s lander should be available for missions starting in 2023.\\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer. Marco Villa, the company\\x19s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage that experience in its lunar landers. \\x1cWe\\x19re going to start with something smaller,\\x1d he said. \\x1cOur flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead us to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.\\x1d He declined to say when his company\\x19s lander would be ready.\\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-ramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year ago: Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive Machines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond. In May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and OrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order two months later, citing internal business issues.\\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be released \\x1csometime soon\\x1d for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for the VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for science instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two \\x1cdeliveries\\x1d of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\\n \\n'"

        "articleBody": "b\"I learned that over a dozen people tapped on the profile of a coworker after I tagged us eating Mexican food in my story. And I found out 46 people, for some reason or another, visited my profile in the last week\\x14but only 16 had come from the one picture I uploaded. On that photo, of one of my oldest friends, I had written a long and gushing caption celebrating her birthday. My business account informed me that someone sent it to another person via direct message, but I couldn\\x19t tell who or why. The analytics made salient the ways my friends and acquaintances surveil one another on Instagram all the time.\\x1cI was stunned just to see how many people visited my profile even without posting for several months,\\x1d said Joseph Minga, a friend who recently switched to a professional Instagram account. He learned around 75 to 100 people view his profile a week, out of around 1,500 followers. \\x1cIt really made me take a step back and ask what are they looking for on here? and in all seriousness, could I have a cyberstalker?\\x1dInstagram also lets you see how people interact with your stories, including how many view them more than once, and the number who swipe away. \\x1cI was on vacation with my parents in France and posted it on my story. And like, of my 1,000 followers, five swiped away,\\x1d said Will Tjernlund, a consultant for Amazon sellers who has a business Instagram account. \\x1cIt\\x19s like wholesome content, that\\x19s normal, and a cool image and background, and someone following me was like nah, not for me dog.\\x1dEven though Instagram\\x19s professional analytics are extremely granular, they\\x19re still anonymized, and can\\x19t account for the reason why someone took a specific action. That makes it easy to agonize about what you don't know. \\x1cSince I have seen some of the extra data, I will question why I lost 14 followers in a week where I did not post anything at all. I don\\x19t post as often anymore,\\x1d said Minga. \\x1cI think I have some sort of social media stage fright. Seeing that people were forwarding my posts to others via DM made me feel insecure.\\x1dIs there something you think we should know about Instagram? Email the writer at louise_matsakis@wired.com.

You can also mail us materials at 520 Third Street, Suite 350, San Francisco, CA 94107.In addition to behavior metrics, Instagram provides business accounts with a wealth of demographic data about their followers. That includes where they live, how old they are, whether they\\x19re male of female (there\\x19s no recognition of users who identify as nonbinary or transgender) and the times of day they\\x19re active on the platform. It\\x19s easy to see how this information would be useful to an influencer trying to boost engagement, or a brand who wants to know more about their audience. Instagram also attaches a large \\x1cPromote\\x1d button to every post, giving people the option to turn them into ads.As both NBC News and Bloomberg have reported, there\\x19s a security risk associated with business Instagram accounts, which is particularly hazardous for minors. When people convert to business accounts, they often accidentally make their email address or phone number public. The feature is meant to make it easy for people to contact legitimate business entities, but kids with business accounts also end up revealing their personal information to the world.WIRED spoke to one mother, who knew her teenage daughter and son were masquerading as a Tax Preparation Service and a Go-Kart Track on Instagram, but didn\\x19t realize their personal information might be on their profiles. \\x1cI am so ahead of every other parent of teens I know when it comes to technology,\\x1d she said. \\x1cI am literally facepalming that my 14-year-old son has a public Instagram account with his phone number on it.\\x1d Her daughter, on the other hand, had cleverly put down the number for Pizza Hut instead.\\x1cBusinesses and creators are clearly informed in the sign-up or conversion flow that the contact information they would like to make public to help people contact them will be displayed,\\x1d Lino said. Last month, Instagram also made it possible for creator and business accounts to choose not to display their contact information.David Stier, a data scientist and business advisor in the Bay Area, has spent the last few months trying to track the global number of minors who may have professional Instagram accounts. He stumbled upon the issue while researching Instagram marketing for a potential client and became concerned. Because users can easily toggle between being corporations, \\x1ccreators,\\x1d and normal people, Stier says he noticed the lines between all three groups on Instagram have blurred. \\x1cThis thing is broken, like completely broken, in terms of a way of classifying and identifying what kind of an entity you are,\\x1d he says.Maybe Instagram likes it that way. After all, the platform has helped thousands of people monetize otherwise personal content about their lives. The boundaries between a money-making entity and a personal scrapbook are gone. Microinfluencers, and even nanoinfluencers (people with only a few thousand followers on Instagram at most), are now paid to hawk products like makeup and shampoo. Are these accounts actual businesses, in the traditional sense? Maybe not, but they often have access to the same analytics as one.More Great WIRED Stories\\n\""

At least 106 protesters in 21 cities have been killed, according to credible reports received by Amnesty.

State media have reported only a handful of protester deaths, as well as the deaths of at least four members of the security forces.  Video footage shows security forces using firearms, water cannons and tear gas to disperse protests and beating demonstrators with batons.

        "articleBody": "b'Sweden has dropped its investigation into a 2010 rape allegation against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange after a review of the evidence. \\x1cAfter conducting a comprehensive assessment of what has emerged during the course of the preliminary investigation, I then make the assessment that the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment,\\x1d Sweden\\x19s deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said on Tuesday. Persson explained that the complainant\\x19s evidence had initially been deemed credible and reliable, but after additional investigations, it had been made clear that the oral testimony given in support of the woman had weakened, primarily because a long time had passed and the witnesses\\x19 memories had faded for natural reasons. She added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of Sweden\\x19s attorney general. Assange is battling extradition to the United States, which accuses him of publishing secret documents related to his WikiLeaks work. He had been facing the rape charge in Sweden since 2010. The case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange because the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the Australian national remained in London. However, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and promptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status. That came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid extradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case. Following Assange\\x19s arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the case asked for the investigation to be resumed.\\nThe journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related allegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out. Assange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in Britain for skipping bail. The US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010. The US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted of all the charges against him there.

        "articleBody": "b' Though recommendation widgets are the most popular type of native ad units and generate the greatest revenue, optimal native ad performance on both the demand and supply side is achieved by running the range of native ad units.\\nNew York, NY\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\x13 \\xef\\xbf\\xbdThe range of native ad units now available have powered native ad spending past all other forms of display advertising in 2017, according to analysis from Poynter.\\nBut are all native ads equal for marketers and publishers?\\nTo answer this question and gain a greater understanding of the range of native ad units, the my6sense data analytics team analyzed billions of recommendation widget, in-feed and in-ad native ad units served via my6sense\\x19s white label programmatic native ad platform in the last 6 months of 2017.\\n\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nOn the\\xef\\xbf\\xbdsupply side, recommendation widgets are the most profitable among the native ad units, followed closely by in-feed ad units, which are 20% less profitable than recommendation widgets. Recommendation widgets provide publishers with an\\neffective way to recirculate organic content which increases publisher engagement metrics including time spent and pages viewed while also generating revenue from the additional ads viewed. In-feed ads earn the highest revenue per ad but generate a lower RPM (Revenue Per Thousand) for publishers since recommendation widgets include multiple ads in the same ad unit.\\nIn-feed units provide the supply side with a new revenue stream when they appear within content lists and articles. Among the three primary native ad units, in-ad units generate about one quarter of the revenue of recommendation widgets, yet are quick and easy to implement at scale on standard banner placements with no required layout changes, while they outperform traditional banner ads from both revenue and user experience perspectives.\\nOn the demand side, in-feed ads generate the highest CTR and user engagement, 2.5 times greater than ads in recommendation widgets and about 10 times higher than ads within in-ad units. The ratio was similar when comparing effective CPMs for paid ad items across these three types of native ad units.\\nThe strong performance of in-feed ads for brand campaigns is the result of the exclusive presence they receive as the only ad in view with larger images and longer texts, resulting in higher engagement rates. While in-feed ads dominate for branding campaigns, recommendation widgets and in-ad units, which are more cost-effective, perform better for direct response campaigns.\\nThough each of the three native ad units is unique, the best performing native ad campaigns for advertisers are those running with optimized A/B creatives in recommendation widgets, in-feed and in-ad units combined. And on the supply side, the combination of all three ad units results in the greatest revenue rates for publishers.\\n\\x1cIn the same way Olympic champions utilize a broad range of training activities to achieve peak performance, my6sense marketers achieving the highest engagement rates and publishers generate the greatest revenue by running all three native ad units in parallel \\x13 recommendation widgets, in-feed and in-ad,\\x1d said Avinoam Rubinstain, CEO & founder, my6sense.\\nWhich native ad units are the most popular?\\nRecommendation widgets are the most popular form of native ad units (38%), followed by in-feed units (30%), in-ad units (25%) and finally textual and custom designs (7%).\\nDespite the smaller screen size, native ads on mobile devices generate twice the CTR of native ads on desktops, though the effective CPM is 30% lower on mobile because advertisers still pay more for desktop ads.\\nmy6sense provides the only fully programmatic native exchange solution for multi-item native ad units combined with comprehensive organic content recirculation, enabling clients and partners to easily mix recommendation widgets, in-feed, in-ad units and any other custom native ad units with any number of ad items on the page.\\nAbout my6sense\\nmy6sense offers an open programmatic white label native advertising platform for ad networks, media trading companies, group publishers, DSPs and SSPs.

Credit: 20th Century Fox   \\nIf a sci-fi spaceship does not come with hyperdrive then it is usually fitted with hibernation capsules instead. In movies from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Event Horizon, Alien to Passengers, fictional astronauts get put into \"suspended animation\" to cross the vastness of space. Now ESA has investigated how real life crew hibernation would impact space mission design.   Human hibernation has been the subject of initial research within the Discovery element of ESA\\'s Basic Activities, then recommended as a key \"enabling technology\" for space by the Agency\\'s Future Technology Advisory Panel, resulting in a dedicated \"Topical Team\" on hibernation.\\nNow the Agency\\'s SciSpacE team has called in ESA\\'s Concurrent Design Facility\\x14a multimedia facility enabling expert teams to perform initial evaluations of proposed future missions\\x14to assess the advantages of human hibernation for a trip to a neighboring planet, such as Mars.\\nBeginning with an assessment on the current state of the art in human hibernation, with the help of ESA Topical Team scientists from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the University of Goethe, Frankfurt, the CDF team went to investigate for the first time the potential impact of hibernation on system-level mission design. They took as their reference an existing mission study to send six humans to Mars and back in a five year timescale.\\n\"We worked on adjusting the architecture of the spacecraft, its logistics, protection against radiation, power consumption and overall mission design,\" comments Robin Biesbroek of the CDF.\\n     A reference habitation module for a crewed Mars mission compared to its hibernation-based equivalent. Credit: ESA   \\n\\n\"We looked at how an astronaut team could be best put into hibernation, what to do in case of emergencies, how to handle human safety and even what impact hibernation would have on the psychology of the team. Finally we created an initial sketch of the habitat architecture and created a roadmap to achieve a validated approach to hibernate humans to Mars within 20 years.\"\\nThe study found the spacecraft mass could be reduced by a third by removing the crew quarters with a similar reduction in consumables, equivalent to several tons of saved mass. Hibernation would take place in small individual pods that would double as cabins while the crew are awake.\\nThe assumption was that a drug would be administered to induce \"torpor\"\\x14the term for the hibernating state. Like hibernating animals, the astronauts would be expected to acquire extra body fat in advance of torpor. Their soft-shell pods would be darkened and their temperature greatly reduced to cool their occupants during their projected 180-day Earth-Mars cruise. The hibernating cruise phase would end with a 21 day recuperation period\\x14although based on the experience of animal hibernation, the expectation would be that the crew would not experience bone or muscle wastage.\\n     Functional areas of the hibernation module: (1) private crew quarters, (2) exercise, (3) hygiene and waste, (4) dining and wardroom, (5) workstation, (6) galley and food, (7) medical supplies, (8) life support systems and stowage, (9) operational and maintenance supplies.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdIn general, the habitat is divided into two zones of habitable volumes: the crew quarters which are used during the entire mission duration, and the volumes for wardroom and workstation, food preparation and eating, waste collection and hygiene, exercise, medical, operational and maintenance purposes that are only used during the time the crew is awake and active. Credit: ESA        A cross-section through the hibernation module showing the individual quarters that would double as hibernation pods during the cruise phase. The soft-shelled pods would have individual thermal controls and flexible insulation, with a fan to circulate air and control humidity to prevent condensation when the temperature is reduced during hibernation. The pods would also be well shielded against radiation.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd(1) private crew quarters, (8) life support system and stowage, (10) circulation space. Credit: ESA    \\nRadiation exposure from high-energy particles is a key hazard of deep space travel, but because the hibernating crew will be spending so much time in their hibernation pods, then shielding\\x14such as water containers\\x14could be concentrated around them. And existing research into hibernation shows it gives enhanced radiation protection in its own right.\\nBut with all the crew incapacitated for extended periods of time, the mission would have to be designed for largely autonomous operations, with optimum use of artificial intelligence and \"fault detection, isolation and recovery\" to maintain a minimum level of system performance until the crew could be revived.\\n\"For a while now hibernation has been proposed as a game-changing tool for human space travel,\" explains SciSpacE Team Leader Jennifer Ngo-Anh. \"If we were able to reduce an astronaut\\'s basic metabolic rate by 75% \\x13 similar to what we can observe in nature with large hibernating animals such as certain bears\\x14we could end up with substantial mass and cost savings, making long-duration exploration missions more feasible.\\n\"And the basic idea of putting astronauts into long-duration hibernation is actually not so crazy: a broadly comparable method has been tested and applied as therapy in critical care trauma patients and those due to undergo major surgeries for more than two decades. Most major medical centers have protocols for inducing hypothermia in patients to reduce their metabolism to basically gain time, keeping patients in a better shape than they otherwise would be.\\n\"We aim to build on this in future, by researching the brain pathways that are activated or blocked during initiation of hibernation, starting with animals and proceeding to people.\"   More information: G.

It means America \\x1chas the world\\x19s highest rate of children in detention.\\x1d                 Tuesday November 19, 2019    After three days of congressional hearings, only one witness has emerged so far with a legitimate gripe, and it has nothing to do with the substance of the impeachment pursuit of President Trump.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    It is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and personal backgrounds of the House\\'s key impeachment witnesses, including Ambassador William Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, has been tied to what Acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor dubbed the \\x1cirregular channel\\x1d of Ukraine policy, featuring Rudy Giuliani, Gordon Sondland, and others. But Volker sought to distance himself from this channel during his testimony on Tuesday, making himself out to be a naive pawn in Giuliani\\x19s meddling.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    People are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on their impeachment \\x1cscandal.\\x1d In week two of the impeachment investigation, the case is firmly closed \\x14 Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for merely doing his job. Here is what we learned:                 Tuesday November 19, 2019    Beyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-Ukraine relationship remains strong. American aid continues flowing to Ukraine; the U.S. government continues to actively support President Volodymyr Zelensky\\'s efforts to reduce corruption and confront Russian aggression.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    The first leaders debate on Tuesday for the U.K. general election due to be held on Dec. 12 was a shambles.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    The core of the impeachment question has always rested on a quid pro quo: Did President Trump threaten to withhold congressionally approved aid to a foreign government to harm his domestic political foe? Instead, the Democrats attempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the pivot bombed fantastically.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman made it clear in his testimony before Congress on Tuesday that he took his concerns about President Trump\\x19s dealings with Ukraine \\x14 of which there were many \\x14 directly to his superiors. He did not leak those concerns to the press, he said.                 Tuesday November 19, 2019    China\\x19s attempt to gain economic influence in Europe poses major strategic threats to American allies, according to defense officials, including one on the front lines of NATO.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    Monday\\'s news that the beloved fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A would no longer donate to organizations critical of the gay and transgender community left some with a bad taste in their mouth. Unsurprisingly, members of the militant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, continue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the announcement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold Christian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\" will not be satisfied.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    Jimmy Kemp sounds a whole lot like his eloquent father, the late Republican official and idea man Jack Kemp, and this is a very good thing. The U.S. political world needs to start rehearing the Kempian message.             Tuesday November 19, 2019    Religious liberty and conscience rights are certainly worth defending against an increasing liberal onslaught. A female wax technician should never be forced by the state to wax a transgender woman\\x19s testicles. Nor should a Christian baker be forced to endorse messages he doesn\\x19t believe in.

        "articleBody": "b'Binge eating disorder (BED) is considered the most common feeding and eating disorder in the United States (1). BED is about more than food, it\\x19s a recognized psychological condition. That means people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a medical professional to overcome it.People who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually large amounts, even when they\\x19re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a strong sense of guilt or shame. Regular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.Fortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try \\x14 both at home and with the help of a professional \\x14 to reduce episodes of binge eating.Here are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.1. Ditch the dietFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.For example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binge eating (2).Similarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (3).Instead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or significantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making healthy changes.Eat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better health.Summary Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods completely.2. Avoid skipping mealsSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most effective ways to overcome binge eating.Skipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.One small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased levels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater extent than eating three meals per day (4).Another study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).Try setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.Summary Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting blood sugar.3. Practice mindfulnessMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment.This technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize when they no longer feel hungry.One review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (6).Another small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (7).Try listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally, try to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.Summary Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you\\x19re no longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the incidence of binge eating.4. Stay hydratedDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to curb cravings and stop overeating.In fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to decreased hunger and calorie intake.For example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group (8).Similarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13\\x1317 ounces (375\\x13500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (9).Other studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and weight loss (10, 11).The amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors. Thus, it\\x19s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to ensure you\\x19re staying well hydrated.Summary Drinking more water can keep you feeling full to decrease calorie intake and prevent binge eating.5. Try yogaYoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific breathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance relaxation.Studies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce the risk of emotional eating.One small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks led to a significant reduction in binging (12).Another study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating disorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances \\x14 all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating (13).Research also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like cortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating (14, 15).Try joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your routine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home.Summary Yoga can help prevent binge eating and may reduce common triggers like stress, depression, and anxiety.6. Eat more fiberFiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full longer (16).Some research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce appetite, and food intake.One small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of fiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing fullness (17).Another study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber daily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and significantly reduced feelings of hunger (18).Fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods that can keep you feeling full.Summary Fiber can help keep you feeling full to reduce calorie intake and feelings of hunger.7. Clean out the kitchenHaving lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much easier to binge eat.Conversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional eating by limiting the number of unhealthy options.Start by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-packaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.Stocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge eating unhealthy foods.Summary Removing unhealthy foods from your kitchen and stocking up on healthy alternatives can improve diet quality and make it harder to binge eat.8. Start hitting the gymStudies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge eating.For instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly exercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants (19).Another study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with regular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of binge eating than therapy alone (20).Plus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and enhance mood to prevent emotional eating (21).Walking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few different forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce binge eating.Summary Studies show that exercising can reduce the risk of binge eating and decrease stress levels.9. Eat breakfast every dayStarting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge eating later in the day.Several studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is associated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates feelings of hunger (4, 5).Plus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings and reduce hunger throughout the day.For example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast reduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb breakfast (22).Meanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve appetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people (23).Try combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole grains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating.Summary Eating a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast can prevent cravings and keep you satisfied throughout the morning.10. Get enough sleepSleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be linked to binge eating.In fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported significantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this condition (24).Another large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin \\x14 the hormone responsible for promoting fullness.Additionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body weight (25).Aim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check and reduce your risk of binge eating.Summary BED may be linked to increased symptoms of insomnia. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter the levels of hormones that affect hunger and appetite.11. Keep a food and mood journalKeeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can be an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food triggers and promote healthier eating habits.One study in 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that involved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes of binge eating (26).Several other studies also suggest that tracking your intake may be linked to increased weight loss and aid long-term weight management (27, 28, 29).To get started, simply start recording what you eat and how you feel each day using either a journal or app.Summary Food and mood journals can help identify triggers to address potential problems. Studies show that using a food diary is associated with fewer episodes of binge eating, as well as increased weight loss.12. Find someone to talk toTalking to a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your likelihood of overeating.One study in 101 adolescents undergoing sleeve gastrectomy showed that reliable social support was associated with less binge eating (30).Another study in 125 women with obesity found that better social support was linked to decreased binge eating severity (31).A good social support system is thought to reduce the impact of stress, which may help decrease your risk of other coping habits like emotional eating (32, 33).Next time you feel like binge eating, pick up the phone and call a trusted friend or family member. If you don\\x19t have someone to talk to, eating disorder helplines are available free of charge.Summary A good social support system may be linked to decreased binge eating and stress.13. Increase your protein intakeUpping your intake of protein-rich foods can keep you feeling full and help control your appetite.One study in 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% led to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, as well as decreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories (34).Similarly, another study found that following a high-protein diet enhanced metabolism, promoted feelings of fullness, and increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite (35).Try including at least one good source of protein \\x14 such as meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, or legumes \\x14 in each meal and enjoy high-protein snacks when you feel hungry to keep cravings at bay.Summary Increasing your protein intake has been shown to decrease calorie intake, enhance feelings of fullness, and increase levels of GLP-1, a hormone that can help suppress appetite.14. Plan mealsPlanning meals can help ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand to prepare nutritious meals. Also, measuring out portion sizes and putting the remainder of food away may help you avoid triggering a binge. In fact, one study in over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was associated with improvements in diet quality and variety, as well as a lower risk of obesity (36).Meal planning also makes it easier to stick to a regular eating pattern, which has been linked to a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).Set aside an hour or two each week to plan out a weekly rotation for your meals.Summary Meal planning has been associated with improvements in diet quality and variety. It can also make sticking to a regular eating pattern easier and ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand at all times.15. Seek help While the strategies above can be helpful, oftentimes a treatment plan designed by a professional is needed to help overcome binging.Treatment for BED can involve different types of therapy or medications to help get binging under control and treat any underlying causes or symptoms.Cognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective form of therapy, explores the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns and then develops strategies to modify your behavior (37).Other types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss therapy (37).Antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also sometimes used to treat BED, though more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of these medications (38, 39).Summary Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered an effective treatment method for binge eating. Other types of therapy and certain medications can also be used.The bottom lineBED is a recognized psychological condition that affects millions of people around the world. However, it\\x19s possible to overcome it with the right treatment plan and healthy lifestyle modifications. \\n'"

View all (4)  \\nRebranded to resemble a neutral fact-checking account, it posted a series of tweets supporting Johnson during Tuesday\\x19s debate. It later reverted to the name \\x1cCCHQ Press\\x1d and restored the party logo to its profile.Organizations that seek to combat political misinformation cried foul.\\x1cIt was an attempt to mislead voters,\\x19\\x19 Will Moy, chief executive of the London-based fact-checking website Full Fact, told the BBC. \\x1cAnd I think it is inappropriate and misleading for a serious political party to behave that way.\\x1dForeign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the party\\x19s actions, saying the Twitter account was clearly linked to the Conservatives.\\x1cWe make no apology for having an instant rebuttal to all the nonsense and lies put out,\\x1d Raab told the BBC.Twitter pledged to take \\x1cdecisive corrective action\\x1d against similar strategies in the future. But the manipulation of the account in a high-profile event put the issue of the rise of digital campaigning squarely in the public eye.All political parties are devoting much of their campaign spending to the digital realm as they battle to win the U.K.\\x19s Dec. 12 election.Despite parliamentary reports urging new regulations to combat misinformation or regulate the way digital ads are targeted at voters, officials in Britain have made no significant changes to laws governing online ads, social media and election disinformation.In a reflection of the confusion, the Electoral Commission, which regulates campaign finances, issued a statement warning that \\x1cvoters are entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners in the lead-up to an election.\\x19\\x19 Critically, however, it pointed out that it doesn\\x19t have \\x1ca role in regulating election campaign content.\\x19\\x19With the absence of law, campaigns have already been pressing the boundaries to get attention. The Conservative Party became embroiled in controversy earlier this month when it posted a video on social media containing a misleading edit of a television interview with Keir Starmer, a senior Labour Party figure. The video had been altered to show Starmer failing to answer a question about Brexit, when, in fact, he responded quickly. The chairman of the Conservative Party described the doctored video as lighthearted satire.In their first TV debate of the election on Tuesday, Johnson and Corbyn attacked each other\\x19s policies on Brexit, health care and the economy.But the debate likely failed to answer the question that has dogged the campaign: Who can voters trust? The two leaders sidestepped tricky questions about their own policies in the hourlong encounter and drew derisive laughter from the studio audience at several points.Both Johnson and Corbyn are trying to overcome a mountain of mistrust as they try to win over a Brexit-weary electorate.Johnson is under fire for failing to deliver on his often-repeated vow that Britain would leave the EU on Oct. 31.Audience members laughed when he urged voters, \\x1cLook what I have said I\\x19m going to do as a politician and look what I\\x19ve delivered.\\x1dCorbyn, a stolid socialist, is accused by critics of promoting high-tax policies and of failing to clamp down on anti-Semitism within his party. His refusal to say which side he would be on in a Brexit referendum was also met with hoots of laughter.Televised debates are a relatively new phenomenon in British elections \\x14 the first took place in 2010 \\x14 and they have the power to transform campaigns. A confident 2010 appearance by former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg sparked a wave of \\x1cCleggmania\\x1d that helped to propel him into the deputy prime minister post in a coalition government with the Conservatives.

        "articleBody": "b\" Three cases of plague have been diagnosed in China, sparking widespread fears about the spread of the disease, though officials say the risk of an outbreak is low. As Emily Feng reports for NPR, the first cases came to light last week, when authorities in Beijing announced that two infected individuals sought treatment at a hospital in the capital. The patients, a husband and wife, are from Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the northern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, one of the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis\\x14the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the infection spreads to the lungs. Yersinia pestis, per the WHO, is often found in small mammals and their fleas. Pneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly contagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets. Without medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery rates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. The ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people who might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the New York Times. All \\x1crelevant sites\\x1d were also disinfected, reports Wee. The CDC assured the public on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media site, that the risks of transmission were \\x1cextremely low.\\x1d On November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also from Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the Washington Post, killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around 185 miles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague. The Associated Press reports that 28 people who came into contact with the patient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plague\\x14like the sudden onset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no epidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the Inner Mongolia health commission said, according to Reuters. Over the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world, most famously during the Black Death, which wiped out nearly one-third of Europe\\x19s population in the 1300s. Yersinia pestis is believed to have originated in China, spreading to the West via ships. Today, plague infections are rare, but they do happen. According to WHO, there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has experienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent years\\x1426 cases and 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports Reuters.  Though the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake of the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are minimizing or even restricting information about the cases. The first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to NPR\\x19s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were treated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the facility on November 3\\x14nine days before an announcement was made, raising questions about the reason for the delay. Li explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified, and announcements about them cannot be \\x1ctransmitted casually.\\x1d But her post was still taken down by censors. Wee of the Times reports that censors had also instructed digital news aggregators to \\x1cblock and control\\x1d discussions pertaining the news about the plague. \\x1cDon't hide things like this,\\x1d one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. \\x1cLet\\x19s face whatever it is together.\\x1d Current fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by China\\x19s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were accused of concealing the true extent of the country\\x19s SARS outbreak\\x14and Beijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times as many cases as they had initially reported. In the wake of that outbreak, China \\x1cvastly improved its detection and management of infectious diseases,\\x1d writes the Associated Press. And though the Chinese CDC has said that there is \\x1cno need\\x1d for Beijing residents to worry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote regions of the country\\x14like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau\\x14are vulnerable to outbreaks. Officials have warned people to stay away from infected areas, and to avoid contact with rodents.  Like this article? SIGN UP for our newsletter \\n\""

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Ithaca Holdings) \"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider added of the continuing spat.On Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it possible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards after Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned company of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own the master recordings, at the AMAsA LONG, DRAWN OUT HISTORY OF TAYLOR SWIFT\\'S FEUDSThe statement, which was obtained by\\xef\\xbf\\xbdVariety,\\xef\\xbf\\xbdclaimed that Big Machine and Dick Clark Productions had \\x1ccome to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists\\x19 performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platform.\\x1d The agreement maintained that it would not only cover Swift\\x19s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media.

Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\\nI know \\x14 it all looks so good. But you can\\x19t eat it all, so it\\x19s time to set priorities.\\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks \\x14 those that are vegetable based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you\\x19re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\\nAnd you don\\x19t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can\\x19t live without and leave it at that.\\n2. Don\\x19t forget to drink water\\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you\\x19re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they\\x19re there.\\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we\\x19re feeling especially hungry.\\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\\nThat\\x19s especially true when we are watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there \\x14 and without realizing it, we\\x19ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying our food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you\\x19re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don\\x19t overdo it.\\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don\\x19t let your fingers do the walking.\\n\\n4. \\x1cVeggie-fy\\x1d your chips \\x18n\\x19 dip\\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip. But instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a veggie instead.\\nBecause let\\x19s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it\\x19s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you\\x19ll see that you\\x19ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\\nAnd don\\x19t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip \\x14 those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\\nHealthy Game Day Dip: \\nMix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories. Enjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you\\x19ll get plenty of tangy crunch \\x14 without all the calories.\\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you\\x19re saving nearly 100 calories \\x14 about the same as a bottle of light beer.\\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats? This is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself \\x1cno.\\x1d That\\x19s why I always tell my clients: \\x1can open face is a happy face!\\x1d\\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you\\x19re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks \\x14 without overdoing it!\\nGet started with\\xef\\xbf\\xbd2B Mindset here.\\n\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd \\n'"

They\\x19re selling:Courses on writing a bookWorkshops on becoming a highly paid speakerClasses on running successful webinarsThese are all good things.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdThey\\x19re all things I\\x19ve done myself!

Start small and recognize that no one is watchingHere\\x19s an analogy:When you\\x19re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online businesses \\x14 planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft versions of both \\x14 there\\x19s a helpful way to think about what you\\x19re doing.Imagine you\\x19re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are drawn. No one in the audience can see what you\\x19re doing back there!You\\x19re planning and building what you\\x19ll reveal to the world \\x14 but you haven\\x19t pulled back the curtains and invited them in.Here\\x19s what I want you to remember &When you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat and sweat beading on your upper lip?No one is watching.I mean, if you\\x19re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience in the early days. But for the most part? There\\x19s almost no one there.It\\x19s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer people watching your first visibility attempts, you won\\x19t feel as intimidated by the process.So start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section &2. Don\\x19t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1A few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse\\x19s Problogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was creating online \\x1cevents\\x1d that build your audience.In that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many opportunities to step out of your comfort zone.And I\\xef\\xbf\\xbdused this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:It got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is &It\\x19s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the more intimidating things.Increasing your visibility gradually lets you grow into your online leadership role with much less stress.Click To TweetEveryone\\x19s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used to look like this:NOT SCARYWriting a blog postWriting a piece of email marketingSpeaking to someone on the phoneKIND OF SCARYPublishing the blog postSending the piece of email marketingSpeaking to someone on a video callINTIMIDATINGParticipating in a podcast interviewSpeaking as a member of a panelPresenting a live webinarTERROR LEVEL 100Delivering the keynote speech at a conferenceHosting a live video on a social media platformPublishing and promoting a bookHere\\x19s the thing:I didn\\x19t go from the Non-scary stuff to the Terror Level 100 list.Instead, I moved from the Non-scary to the Kind of Scary stuff. I mastered the Kind of Scary list and moved on to the Intimidating list. I got comfortable with the\\xef\\xbf\\xbdIntimidating list and found myself ready to tackle the Terror Level 100 list.All the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more resilient.As you push into your next level of discomfort, you\\x19ll find yourself being asked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to write blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote addresses at their conferences.The good news?You\\x19ll have a strong success mindset and you\\x19ll be ready for it all.3. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindsetWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.We sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach across the world and draw an audience to us & without having to leave the comfort of our homes, if we don\\x19t want to.But sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role that will benefit you and your business.When it comes to moving yourself along the \\x1cvisibility spectrum\\x1d toward a leadership role, it\\x19s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive colleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your frustrations; and are generous with their support.I can\\x19t tell you how many times I\\x19ve reached out to colleagues and said something along the lines of &\\x1cArgh! I know I need to do this but it\\x19s scary!\\x1dHaving a team of people around you that you can be \\x1creal\\x1d with is vital if you want to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.I\\x19m\\xef\\xbf\\xbdvery\\xef\\xbf\\xbdhappy to say that a I\\x19m building that team of people for you right now.If you\\x19d like to find out more about the BIG League \\x14 my community for online business builders \\x14 download the Online Business Success Roadmap. It\\x19s the approach we follow in the program.Here\\x19s how to switch up your success mindset and become the online leader your business needsLet\\x19s quickly recap what we covered in this article:Start small and recognize that no one is watching. The early days are the perfect time to explore things that feel uncomfortable \\x14 your audience is small and you won\\x19t feel as intimidated.Don\\x19t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1. Remember, online leadership and authoritative visibility exist on a spectrum. Move along it step-by-step and your confidence will grow naturally.Get support for the scary stuff. If you are truly committed to growth, consider joining a group where the other members will have your back and offer support when you\\x19re about to take a big, scary step.\\x1cBecome an online leader\\x1d sounds like a tall order.

The Islanders trailed by two late in the third period before goals by Josh Bailey and Ryan Pulock in the final 4:29 of regulation forced overtime. Nelson won it when he fired a shot at Matt Murray that trickled to the goaltender's right. Nelson tapped the rebound into the open net for his sixth goal of the season.  Anthony Beauvillier added his seventh for the Islanders, and Semyon Varlamov stopped 27 shots as New York improved to 14-0-1 in its last 15 games.  Wild 4, Sabres 1: Zach Parise scored twice, Alex Stalock made 30 saves and Minnesota beat Buffalo. Jason Zucker had a goal and an assist, and Jonas Brodin also scored for the Wild, who improved to 4-2-1 in their last seven. Brandon Montour scored for the Sabres and Linus Ullmark stopped 22 shots. Buffalo is on a 1-6-2 skid and battling injuries at the forward position following 9-2-1 start.     Bruins 5, Devils 1: David Pastrnak and Matt Grzelcyk scored two goals apiece, and Brad Marchand added three assists to lead Boston. Tuukka Rask made 25 saves and New Jersey native Connor Clifton added a goal as the Bruins beat the Devils for the eighth time in nine meetings. Blake Coleman scored for New Jersey, which was looking for its first three-game winning streak since December 2018.   Panthers 5, Flyers 2: Aleksander Barkov and Brett Connolly each had a goal and an assist to lift Florida. Jonathan Huberdeau, Colton Sceviour and Mike Hoffman also scored and Evgenii Dadonov had two assists. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 35 shots. The Panthers are 6-2-1 in their past nine games.   Blue Jackets 5, Canadiens 2: Pierre-Luc Dubois had two goals and an assist, rookie Emil Bemstrom added a goal and an assist, and Columbus beat Montreal. Joonas Korpisalo stopped 30 shots for his eighth win as Columbus improved to 8-8-4. Eric Robinson and Boone Jenner also scored for the Blue Jackets. Artturi Lehkonen and Joel Armia had the goals for the Canadiens.  Senators 4, Red Wings 3: Anthony Duclair had two goals and an assist, and Ottawa held on to beat Detroit. John Gabriel Pageau and Brady Tkachuk also scored for Ottawa. Anders Nilsson made 35 saves, including 15 in the third period when the Senators were outshot 16-3. Valtteri Filppula had a goal and an assist, and Robby Fabbri and Anthony Mantha scored for Detroit, which ended a five-game point streak (3-0-2).      Jets 2, Predators 1: Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers scored, Connor Hellebuyck made 38 saves and Winnipeg defeated Nashville. The teams are heading in opposite directions in the tough Central Division. Winnipeg has won three in a row and five of six. The reeling Predators have lost five straight.  Blues 3, Lightning 1: Oskar Sundqvist and David Perron scored to lead St. Louis past Tampa Bay, spoiling Pat Maroon's much-anticipated return after helping his hometown team to a Stanley Cup title last season. Maroon, a St. Louis native, made his first trip back to the city since signing a one-year contract with the Lightning in the offseason.  Hurricanes 4, Blackhawks 2: Nino Niederreiter had a goal and an assist, and Carolina beat Chicago for their fourth straight victory.

        "articleBody": "b\"\\n  Greg Beacham, Ap Sports Writer\\n Updated  1:33\\xc2\\xa0am CST, Wednesday, November 20, 2019  \\n      LOS ANGELES (AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 To LeBron James, triple-doubles are not a goal.  They are only a side effect of the consistent, brilliant all-around play he has been dishing out for 17 NBA seasons, with no slowdown in sight.  Triple-doubles also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean much to LeBron without wins attached to them, so James was pleased when his latest statistical superlative occurred during yet another successful night for the surging Los Angeles Lakers.  James became the first player in NBA history to record a triple-double against every team in the league, and Anthony Davis scored 34 points during the Lakers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fifth straight victory, 112-107 over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night.  James finished with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to post a triple-double against his 30th opponent for the NBA-leading Lakers, who have won 12 of 13 after a perfect four-game homestand. James was more surprised than thrilled by his latest statistical achievement, particularly while a different statistic glared at him from the box score.      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCoach (Frank) Vogel came in here and said, 'Congratulations,' and I thought he was joking about my seven turnovers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d James said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really don't know what to think about it. I just think it's a pretty cool stat to know, and I'm glad it happened in a win.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d             Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James dunks during the first half of the team's NBA basketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, in Los Angeles.

Chiu, AP            LeBron sets triple-double mark, Lakers hold off OKC 112-107   \\n\\n   James has five triple-doubles in the Lakers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 last 10 games, getting four in victories. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a reason for this spree: Although James has constantly filled the stat sheet since he joined the league in 2003, he is leading the NBA this season with 11.1 assists per game, nearly four more than his career average. He has at least 10 assists in six consecutive games, the longest streak of his career.   Vogel has put the ball in James\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hands constantly on offense, and his playmaking acumen has grown along with his chemistry with Davis, as they demonstrated repeatedly against the Thunder. Seven of LeBron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assists came on baskets by Davis.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmazing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be able to do that against every team is something special. I mean, (it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) trippy that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been playing for a long time, so it was a matter of time before it happened, but just a tribute to all his hard work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   James is fifth in NBA history with 86 triple-doubles, but the four players in front of him \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, Lakers great Magic Johnson and Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd \\xe2\\x80\\x94 hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done it against 30 teams. Kidd, who did it against 28 teams, has served as a role model for James\\xe2\\x80\\x99 efforts as a tall point guard.     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just playing terrific basketball,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Vogel said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor him to be doing what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing in his 17th year is just nothing short of remarkable. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no reason to believe he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sustain that for the rest of the season and help us make a real strong playoff push.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Dennis Schr\\xc3\\xb6der scored 20 of his season-high 31 points in a phenomenal first half for the Thunder, who have lost four of five despite two solid performances at Staples Center. Danilo Gallinari added 25 points in his former home arena, and Nerlens Noel had 15.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why (James) is considered probably the best of all time, but I think we did a great job on him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Schr\\xc3\\xb6der said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey obviously hit some tough shots.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  One night after the Thunder barely missed an upset win over the Clippers thanks to a last-minute 3-pointer by former star Paul George, Oklahoma City couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite catch up to the powerful Lakers despite keeping the game close all night.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of things we did well in there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, you know, we came up short in all these games. I think the one sign you can point to is both teams, the Clippers and the Lakers, are really, really good teams, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re competing well at a high level. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just got to do more in order to be able to finish and close out games.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The Thunder won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to wait long for a rematch: These teams meet again in Oklahoma City in three days.  TIP-INS  Thunder: F Hamidou Diallo missed his third straight game with a left knee sprain. ... Schr\\xc3\\xb6der got a technical foul in the third quarter for confronting Davis at the free throw line after Davis dunked and was fouled.  Lakers: Kyle Kuzma left the court in the second quarter with an eye abrasion after teenager Darius Bazley hit him in the right side of his face with an elbow on a drive. Kuzma returned to the bench in the second half, but with obvious damage above his eye. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t return to the game, although Vogel said he was available if necessary. The Lakers plan to re-evaluate him within the next 24 hours.  CLOSEOUT SEQUENCE  James\\xe2\\x80\\x99 3-pointer put the Lakers up 109-98 with 3:08 to play, but the Thunder scored nine straight points to cut the Lakers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lead to two on Gallinari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s free throws with 1:24 left.  After Danny Green got a key offensive rebound for the Lakers, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope drilled a 3-pointer with 55 seconds left. James missed two free throws moments later to keep the Thunder in it, but Oklahoma City couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t score again.  POINT GUARDS BEHAVE  Chris Paul had four points, 10 assists and five rebounds for the Thunder, and he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appear to clash with Rajon Rondo, his opponent in a fight early last season while he was with the Rockets. Rondo had eight points and a season-high 10 assists.  UP NEXT  Thunder: Host the Lakers on Friday.

        "articleBody": "b' (CNN)President Donald Trump, according to the White House, made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed hospital on Saturday for a \"quick exam and labs\" as the first stage of his annual physical.You shouldn\\'t just believe them.Which is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn\\'t minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President\\'s health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.Remember what we already know about this President\\'s health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds. In his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN\\'s chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump\\'s heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)At the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President\\'s physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.Now consider what we know about Trump\\'s visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.So, there\\'s reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor\\'s reports in the past.In December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein. \"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"If it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it\\'s because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn\\'t write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"So, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn\\'t based on Bornstein\\'s medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.(Trump, it\\'s also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton\\'s health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)Given that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post\\'s Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn\\'t paint the full picture.\"We\\'re not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he\\'s in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I\\'ve given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"Which is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren\\'t.This -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House\\'s word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can\\'t take their word for it. And neither should you.\\n'"

        "articleBody": "b'    House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff speaks during a media briefing after a House vote approving rules for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, October 31, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)   Time is not on Adam Schiff\\x19s side. Adam Schiff\\x19s impeachment inquiry is incoherent. Given the impossibility of a senatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the brand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from tormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza, Trump\\x19s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better the optics. Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity when Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper. And the point, after all, was again to drive down Trump\\x19s popularity and render him politically inert.\\n \\n \\nFrom the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation, following the Mueller implosion, his efforts have insidiously gone downhill. Once Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, the nation learned that the Schiff\\x19s gold-standard whistleblower was no such thing. Instead, he seems a rank partisan and sloppy leaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on those who put him up to this present circus.\\nSchiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his own presidential call \\x14 Democrats expected secrecy and coverup, much as the deep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on the presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their dishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet.\\n \\nOne of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff\\x19s own doubling-down admission that he didn\\x19t know the name of the whistleblower. After previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the whistleblower (\\x1cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower\\x1d) \\x14 he now ups the ante, apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower will testify under oath.\\n  Schiff\\x19s astounding assertion that he doesn\\x19t know the whistleblower\\x19s name is as hard to believe as Robert Mueller\\x19s own congressional testimony that he was not familiar with Fusion GPS \\x14 the font of the entire Steele dossier that itself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller\\x19s own appointment.\\nUnlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings, Schiff has no special prosecutor\\x19s finding of felonious presidential behavior. Instead, he has a veritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to find either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime.\\n \\nMueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in the 2016 election. Twenty-two months, over 20 lawyers and investigators and $35 million later, Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or findings of presidential crimes, and then he more or less embarrassed the entire investigation in an enfeebled, deer-in-the-headlights congressional testimony.\\n \\nAt this point, the country would not put up with yet another special prosecutor entrusted to investigate \\x1cUkrainian collusion.\\x1d They would know the post-Mueller drill in advance: A Washington \\x1cwise man\\x1d icon would follow the Mueller script of finding no such crime, while ignoring quite considerable crimes, with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton\\x19s bought-and-paid-for Christopher Steele.\\nMost of Schiff\\x19s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same critical sense: They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that Trump is dangerous, given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless policy. And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that Trump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine. Apparently their supposedly superior ancestries, pedigrees, and education should supersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United States.\\n \\nYet our shocked State Department experts somehow cannot explain why they were abjectly silent during the Obama administration when the \\x1creset\\x1d proved to be virtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin; when Obama on a hot mic both offered the Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it; when Obama declined to send arms to Ukraine; and when Vice President Joe Biden took over as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine\\x19s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have targeted his own morally compromised son.\\nAnd why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration that at last fulfilled their wildest agendas: ending the reset, upping sanctions against Russians, killing hired Russian thugs in Syria, pulling out of the warped missile agreement with Russia, increasing American and NATO defense expenditures, pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment of Russia, and arming Ukraine?\\n \\nWhat would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at the Obama National Security Council gone to the IG \\x14 but only after first consulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes \\x14 to claim third-hand knowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia\\x19s President Medvedev? The Bush-era whistleblower, a prot\\xef\\xbf\\xbdg\\xef\\xbf\\xbd of John Bolton and Dick Cheney, would then have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in the call had confirmed his prior hot-mic, quid pro quo promise to drop missile defense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give \\x1cspace\\x1d to Obama before the 2012 election \\x14 with \\x1cspace\\x1d perhaps defined as the Russians keeping quiet and making Obama\\x19s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up to Election Day. Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama? Would Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the \\x1cwhistleblower\\x19s\\x1d identity secret?\\n \\nMost significantly, Schiff is now working against the clock.\\n \\nEach day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing the American people to vote on their first-team president. There is no Nixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment, a second-term president could not be brought to heel. Schiff has essentially decided to abort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber impeachment.\\nDay-by-day Schiff\\x19s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news blackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners. We are well into the 2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be presidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch. The media-starved peripheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of the suffocated Beto O\\x19Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage.\\nEach day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not, as it promised, address substantive issues. Since January 2018, it has not talked of infrastructure, recalibrated trade deals, budgetary compromises, drug prescription pricing, or anything else other than one iteration after another of attacking Trump. Certainly, if they really believed that Trump was an incompetent buffoon, the better strategy would have been to step aside, let him ruin the economy, and then run in 2020 against his incompetence.\\nIronically, the longer Trump survives, the more likely he\\x19ll grow stronger and dominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners. To get attention back from Schiff, the front-runners must become even shriller and crazier \\x14 from Bernie Sanders\\x19s declaring an end to all deportations to Elizabeth Warren\\x19s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to pay for \\x1cMedicare for all.\\x1d What will happen when these barnstorming senators are trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate?\\nSchiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of Michael Horowitz and John Durham. If sane, Schiff should hurry up; otherwise James Comey or Andrew McCabe might be indicted and smother his narrative. Horowitz is likely to have more criminal referrals, and Durham might well proceed with indictments \\x14 at precisely the time that Schiff is lecturing the nation that its president is a criminal who mysteriously was exonerated by a special counsel.\\nSchiff is also risking Trump exhaustion \\x14 the magical point at which the public tires of the serial psychodramas of the voting-machine ruse, the Electoral College\\x13subversion gambit, removal of Trump by the 25th Amendment, the Logan Act, the emoluments clause, Mueller, Stormy, Cohen, the tax returns, recession, and now Ukraine \\x14 seasoned with 90 percent negative media coverage and celebrity outbursts about blowing up, decapitating, or incinerating Trump. In other words, the more Schiff pushes these serial whines, the closer he gets to Election Day, and the more the people shrug and think, \\x1cEnough already, just vote.\\x1d\\nVoters are also human. Schiff believes that the more chaos he creates, the more the collective public will fall into a fetal position, cover its ears, and scream, \\x1cMake Trump just go away.\\x1d But the opposite is more likely: At some point people sympathize not with the stoners of the declared public enemy, but with the stoned target who is ripped and bloodied by the mob. In the final scene from Braveheart, the once-hated Scottish hero William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is stretched, drawn and quartered, and variously tortured before an English crowd\\nthat\\x19s hissing and calling for more blood \\x14 up until a point.\\n \\nOnce the kings\\x19 torturers exhaust their repertoire of savagery, even the anti-Scottish crowd gets repelled and begins yelling \\x1cMercy!\\x1d\\nSo too, with Trump. After the Dems decided to wage a three-year-long presidential abortion, and attacked Trump\\x19s wife, children, family, businesses, and associates, 24/7, the public has begun finally to wonder at what point enough is enough. People will begin to think the target of unhinged vituperation must be doing something right to warrant such unattractive enemies, and that he is therefore worthy of empathy.\\nIt is perhaps cruel but nonetheless accurate to note that the more Adam Schiff, who has replaced AOC as the new face of the Democratic party, goes before the cameras, the more the transitory attention goes to his head, the more he lies, habitually proves unethical, and becomes morally compromised. And the more the public becomes repulsed by him.\\nIn just this latest impeachment iteration, Schiff has already lied about his staff\\x19s prior contacts with the \\x1cwhistleblower,\\x1d read into the record a complete rewriting of the presidential call transcript, and leaked supposedly secret statements from his partisan witnesses. In other words, the more one sees and hears Adam Schiff, the more one is likely to dislike him \\x14 including his own party\\x19s presidential candidates.\\nNancy Pelosi wants to wrap up impeachment as soon as possible before the debates resume in earnest and the primaries start, before the Horowitz and Durham reports, before the bored public wonders where exactly is the smoking gun, and before Trump\\x19s polls get into the high forties. But mostly she just wants to get the off-putting Schiff off the national stage and to end his career as the icon of current progressivism. When Democratic inquisitors are reduced to lecturing the nation that \\x1chearsay can be much better evidence than direct\\x1d testimony, and when Adam Schiff looks into the cameras and swears he has no idea who the whistleblower is, then it\\x19s time to pack up the circus and leave town.\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd    If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

        "articleBody": "b' The road to retiring early isn\\'t easy.Kathrin Ziegler/Getty The road to retiring early isn\\'t easy. It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In general, here are the steps you can take:\\nHow to retire early\\n1. Define early retirement\\nRetiring early doesn\\'t have to mean never earning a paycheck again \\x14 unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live \\x14 i.e. financial independence \\x14 but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you\\'d like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for \\x14 but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\\n2. Take inventory\\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the\\xef\\xbf\\xbdPhysician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should\\xef\\xbf\\xbdcalculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your\\xef\\xbf\\xbdannual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It\\'s a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\\n3. Establish your target number\\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it\\'s time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year\\'s worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset\\'s free tool can help find one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal \\x14 and even hold you accountable, if you want. \\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n4. Live below your means\\nIt\\'s very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you\\'re working toward early retirement, it\\'s imperative to live below your means as it\\'s the only way to save and invest aggressively.\\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\\nDepending on how much you spend, you\\'ll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American.\\xef\\xbf\\xbdBy contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\\n5. Leverage your income\\nIt\\'s crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort \\x14 it\\'s a short-term solution \\x14 whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\\n6. Max out your retirement accounts\\nThere\\'s at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year\\'s tax return.\\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you\\'re planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won\\'t be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you\\'ve reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions \\x14 not including any earnings \\x14 tax-free, at any time.\\n7. Invest the money that\\'s left over\\nIf you\\'re maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett\\'s favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\\nNeed help crunching the numbers? SmartAsset\\'s free tool can help find a licensed professional near you \\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n8. If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn\\'t so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\\nTommy \\x14 who only goes by his first name online \\x14 retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\\n9. Research your options for health insurance\\n\\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer\\'s health insurance. If you\\'re waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance \\x14 if available to you \\x14 is joining a working spouse\\'s employer-sponsored plan.\\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\\n10. Make a backup plan\\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement \\x14 would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it \\x14 would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line.\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n11. Put Plan A into action \\x14 but enjoy the present, too\\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don\\'t forget to live in the present while you can.\\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire, \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it\\'s not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\"\\nRelated coverage from\\xef\\xbf\\xbdHow to Do Everything: Money: \\n'"

Photograph by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images     Shares of construction goods giant Home Depot are dropping in premarket trading after the company cut full-year sales growth guidance. But its lowered forecast isn\\x19t a problem for the overall market, according to Wall Street. That\\x19s good news for investors. Home Depot (ticker: HD) reported $2.53 in per-share earnings for the third quarter. Wall Street predicted $2.52 a share. The results look OK, but the stock was down 5% in recent trading. Company management said comparable-store sales growth in 2019 will be 3.5%, compared with prior guidance of 4.0%.   \\x1cOur third-quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business, yet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,\\x1d said CEO Craig Menear in the company\\x19s news release. \\x1cWe are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.\\x1d  One Home Depot refers to investments intended to create a \\x1cseamless, interconnected shopping experience\\x1d for customers. In a research report early Tuesday, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski said the market is misinterpreting the results. That creates a buying opportunity, according to the analyst. \\x1cComp sales were light, though operating margins in-line with expectations,\\x1d wrote Matuszewski. \\x1cWe interpret lighter [second-half] results to be more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments versus a softer macro picture.\\x1d  He\\x19s not the only one who isn\\x19t all that worried. Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem points out a couple of additional reasons investors shouldn\\x19t fret. \\x1cWhile certainly a disappointing result, we note that [the company] faced a [0.6% to 0.7%] hurricane headwind in Q3, lumber remains deeply deflationary and Canada a net headwind,\\x1d wrote Fadem in a Tuesday research report. \\x1cExcluding these items, we believe Q3 comps would have been closer to 5%.\\x1d  Still, the stock has slid, and peer Lowe\\x19s (LOW) stock is off too, down 1.8%. Lowe\\x19s reports earnings Wednesday. Home Depot management hosts a conference call at 9 a.m. ET to discuss results with analysts and investors.  Home Depot shares are up about 40% year to date, easily outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 over the same span.

Those gains add to a major gain for shares, climbing more than 80% so far this year.Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, says the stock could be a risky bet with a worthy reward.\"This is a stock that until this year had been getting clobbered,\"  Maley said on CNBC\\'s \"Trading Nation\" on Monday. \"It was down for four straight years, down well over 60%, and the rally has only just recently broken above that multiyear trend line. If it can take it a little bit further and break above $13.60, that will follow that upward break of the trend line with a very nice higher high and will confirm that its long-term trend has broken to the upside.\"\"A little bit more risk but more reward because whenever you buy any stock in the early stages of a change in trend, it always gives you a little more upside potential,\" Maley said.The Coty-Kylie Jenner deal could be the beginning of a new trend for consumer-facing stocks, says John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.\"Here\\'s a company that\\'s willing to pay for the eyeballs and the followers that Kylie Jenner has more so than anything else. So, this could be a new paradigm for the consumer staples, packaged goods industry which, you know, has been suffering because of weak mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce because shelf space has basically become infinite,\" Petrides said during the same segment.Coty acquired a 51% ownership position in Jenner\\'s beauty and cosmetics portfolio, a deal announced at the beginning of the week. Jenner still has a partnership with Ulta Beauty to sell her products in its stores. That relationship began last November and led to several quarters of revenue growth for Ulta.\"I would expect more acquisitions like this going forward because it could be the new model for companies to acquire top-line growth by partnering up with key influencers,\" Petrides said.Disclaimer\\n'"
